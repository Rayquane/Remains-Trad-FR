    <n>Poneys, zèbres et griffons</n>
    <info>Poney - Une espèce dominante vivant à Equestria. Ils sont divisés en 3 races: licornes, pégases, et poneys terrestres. Chaque race possèdent ses avantages et ses désavantages. Les licornes possèdent la télékinésie, et avec un entrainement spécial, elles peuvent exceller dans différents sorts, les pégases peuvent voler, et les poneys terrestres sont les plus forts, endurants et tenaces de tous. On peut fréquemment rencontrer des licornes et des poneys terrestres dans les Terres Désolées. Les pégases sont rarement rencontrés, car la plupart d'entre eux vivent dans leurs villes de nuages et ne descendent jamais.
Zèbres - Habitants d'un pays lointain, l'ennemi principal des poneys pendant la Grande Guerre. Aujourd'hui, leurs descendants sont parfois aperçus dans Equestria, et, malgré que des siècles soient passés, leurs vieille rivalité n'a pas été oubliée. Les zèbres ne possèdent pas la magie comme les licornes mais peuvent se servir de la sorcellerie, malédiction, potions, et amulettes, et certains conaissent l'art de la nécromance.
Les griffons ne sont pas nombreux dans Equestria, et la pluparts d'entre eux sont mercenaires. Physiquement ils sont plus fort que des poneys, et ont la possibilité de voler, mais ne possèdent pas de pouvoir magique.</info>

They represent a combination of the most advanced earth pony technology and unicorn magic and were created for performing variable tasks - from housekeeping to property protection. During the War, combat models were also developed to be used in military operations.
Although no pony produces robots nowadays, many of them are still functional despite centuries past. Mostly, these are combat and security robots that continue to execute built-in programs and are ready to bring all their power down upon any intruder entering their domain</info>

    <n>Il était une fois dans le royaume magique d'Equestria...
... vint une époque où les idéaux d'amitié cédèrent la place à l'envie, à l'égoïsme, à la cupidité et à la cruauté. La Grande Guerre des ressources naturelles a éclaté, dans laquelle il n'y a eu aucun gagnant. Une étincelle magique frappée par des sabots de poney a rapidement fait rage de manière incontrôlable et s'est transformée en flammes qui ont englouti des continents entiers. Le feu du dragon et la magie noire, transformés en armes destructrices, ont presque mis fin à toute vie sur la planète. Le sol, l'eau et l'air ont été empoisonnés par les radiations, les villes ont été détruites, les civilisations se sont effondrées. Les poneys et leurs ennemis ont presque été effacés de la surface de la terre. L'Apocalypse, prédite par des prophètes fous, auxquels presque personne n'a cru jusqu'au dernier jour, est enfin arrivée...
... Mais ce n'était pas encore la fin. De nombreux poneys ont survécu, certains - se cachant dans les immenses abris-étables souterrains, d'autres - s'adaptant d'une manière ou d'une autre aux nouvelles conditions. L'Apocalypse n'était qu'un prologue pour un autre chapitre sanglant de l'histoire des poneys. Sur les Terres Désolés brûlées et empoisonnées, la violence et la cruauté ne sont pas seulement devenues permises - elles sont désormais des moyens de survie...
... Depuis ce jour, le dernier jour de l'ancien Equestria, environ deux-cent années se sont écoulées...</n>

  <gui id="end_good" v="0.8">
    <n>La défaite des forces de l'Enclave près de l'Etable Pi et la perte de l'un des Thunderheads fut un choc au sein de la communauté des pégases. Essayant de sauver la situation et de restaurer leur réputation, l'Enclave a conduit plusieurs nouvelles attaques vers la surface, mais aucune d'elle n'a abouti à un succès. Les forces combinées de la nouvelle union ont repoussé avec brio les forces de l'Enclave à chaque bataille, achevant des victoires étant jusque là impossible au vu des colonies si dispersées auparavant. Finalement, l'information se répandant parmi les civils à propos de la civilisation des poneys de la surface, cela a mené à un discrédit total du gouvernement de la Grande Enclave des Pégases. Les premières tensions se transformèrent en une révolte ouverte et une tentative de renverser le gourverment. La guerre civile entre les généraux coupables pour leurs crimes de guerre, le reste de la société et l'armée fut rapide et sanglante, et les survivants exclus fut forcés de fuir vers la surface. Résidant dans de multiples bases et camps abandonnés,  ils ne posent plus aucun danger mortel que ce soit aux pégases ou aux habitants de la surface, devenant une menace n'attendant que leur éradication dans les Terres Désolées.
Despite the terrible damage and heavy losses, inhabitants of Stable Pi were able to survive and adapt for a new world. It became possible mostly due to the help and protection from Prancing Pony residents and the SteelHooves rangers. The Stable residents paid their debt with technology and rare resources. Medical equipment and supplies, food reserves, pre-war plant seeds helped Prancing Pony and Covertsign residents to enter a new age of growth and development. Soon, the so-called "aid exchange" grew into close cooperation and trade, which turned these settlements into islands of prosperity in the harsh emptiness of the Wasteland.
When the war ended, Covertsign zebras were finally able to experience the feeling they have been missing for many years - security. Led by Askari and with Velvet Remedy`s help settlers overcame hunger, disease and poverty. And though the Equestrian Wasteland still threaten them with raiders, slavers and dangerous predators, the Legion exiles were no longer afraid of the all-seeing eye of their vengeful brethren. Destruction of the regional headquarters and defeat in the war against SteelHooves ruined Caesar`s ambitious plans of conquering these lands, and the Chosen by Fate was forced to turn his gaze to places less difficult to conquer. The removal of the Legion and Enclave threats meant that the time of peace for Covertsign has finally come.
The Prancing Pony Camp has been the largest peaceful settlement in these lands even before @lp was sent to the surface. Now, with new allies and technologies, it began looking like a real city, similar to the pre-war villages in number of settlers. Many ponies headed here searching for a peaceful life, and even some natives of Stable and Covertsign moved to live in a growing camp. Calamity, who became the main negotiator in affairs between the allied settlements, also made considerable efforts for the prosperity of his home. The inhabitants of the Prancing Pony could sleep peacefully, knowing that they were guarded not only by guns of patrols, but also by their close friendship with the Steel Rangers. Covertsign zebras, natural-born scouts, always warned them ahead about possible threats, and scientists and technicians from Stable Pi provided the Prancing Pony with the latest automatic turret system. And as the camp received support from the allies, it always helped them in return.
After eliminating the Enclave threat, SteelHooves devoted himself to the protection and security of his new allies. In return, SteelHooves rangers received regular supply shipments from the “Prancing Pony", and the brothergood archives became filled with secrets of the Stable Pi scientists. Needed so badly after a long and exhausting war, new recruits joined the ranks, many of which previously fought side by side with knights in the war against Enclave. And though these lands were still full of dangers, hope began warming the heart of the old pony. The hope that the Wasteland era will not be the final chapter of pony history, and that sprouts of the new society will manage to grow into something like the old Equestria was.
Even though he always had much to do in other places, the Watcher never forgot about a new corner of peace in the Wasteland. Not only because he considered himself obligated to preserve it, but also because here he hoped to find ponies suitable for his mysterious purpose. But he always paid special attention to the one which, after a while, he began calling his friend. The Watcher and @lp have helped each other many times, both during the war with the Enclave and after it.
And though @lp might never admit this, and perhaps she haven`t even thought about it, it was her who became the catalyst for all those events that happened to others. Not only through the fulfillment of the Mentor`s mission and not only by its influence on the political situation in the region. Like a shooting star, she went through lives of many ponies, changing them and bringing into motion. If not for the desire to help her home in return to all her previous support, the inhabitants of the "Prancing Pony" would never have given so much effort in restoring Stable Pi. If not for her example of reckless courage, Covertsign zebras would never have found strength to stop living underground. Had it not been for the hope, raised by her determination to confront all the horrors and depravities of the Wasteland, SteelHooves would not have seized on a ghostly chance to recover Equestria`s past.
However, @lp herself did not feel any pride in her actions. In an effort to help her friends and atone for guilt, however real or imaginary, for all the bloodshed that happened with her participation, she tirelessly fought the Enclave, and after the victory she began fighting lesser threats. Perhaps @lp thought it was a thing she could do the best. Perhaps she was simply uncomfortable living a peaceful life. However, it was clear that @lp learned many of the Wasteland lessons. And the first of them was that one should never forget what distinguishes ponies from monsters.
Compassion.</n>
  </gui>
  <gui id="end_norm" v="0.8">
    <n>The combined forces of the Prancing Pony, the SteelHooves Rangers, and Covertsign zebras were able to defend Stable Pi by defeating the common enemy. @lp may have contributed the most to the destruction of the pegasus air citadel. However, this alliance was not destined to survive for long: the greatly weakened yet still mortally dangerous, Enclave recognized new enemies and launched military operations against them. Without a unifying core capable of maintaining nascent confidence in each other, the inhabitants of the united settlements preferred to concentrate their forces for defending themselves, and this ultimately worked in enemy`s favor. After such a terrible defeat from the surface savages, the Enclave lost trust and authority in the eyes of the civilian population and needed good news. The good news came from a series of victories over the SteelHooves Rangers, who were forced to defend themselves both from the pegasi and the remnants of Coldsight`s forces at the same time. Lacking support from outside, SteelHooves dispersed his forces to retain territory, and the destruction of their part by quick and merciless raids became an occasion that allowed the Enclave to boast its victory and maintain its position at the helm of the Pegasus society, fighting a protracted war against the surface, still merciless, but no longer so large-scale and costly for the tired and embittered society.
As the war continued, the inhabitants of Stable Pi were abandoned by their recent allies, who were more worried about their own survival. Only their former comrades, the "Chosen Ones" Velvet Remedy and @lp, stayed to help, but their strength was not enough. After restoring a semblance of a former life, the new Stable leadership decided to shut their doors once again. But this time they will be ready to attack first anyone who dares to endanger their way of life. And Stable Pi ponies will never allow themselves trusting the Wasteland savages again.
Covertsign was perhaps the luckiest of all: their small settlement was hard to spot, and their former allies, the "Prancing Pony" camp and SteelHooves Rangers, were the goals of much higher priority for the Enclave. Using their long-practiced skills of hidden existence, they successfully avoided the unnecessary attention of the enemy. However, their life certainly did not get better, despite all the efforts that Velvet made to save the zebras.
A constant threat from the sky forced the “Prancing Pony” camp to live in a state of siege. Its inhabitants never part with weapons, defense systems are maintained in perfect condition, and healthy sleep has been forgotten as a luxury of old times. To make things harder, the pegasi used tactics of starving the inhabitants out, with small hunting groups searching and destroying everypony trying to get food and ammunition for the camp using the old-fashioned method of expeditions to the pre-war ruins. Nevertheless, the resilience and resourcefulness of the camp residents allowed them to keep the Enclave threat out, and Calamity, who became the defense leader, constantly made attempts to counterattack the enemy.
After losing a significant portion of his forces first in the battle for Stable Pi and then during the Enclave raids, SteelHooves was forced to order the give up most of the territory controlled by his rangers, focusing on defending key objects located in vicinity if each other. It gave his enemies a break, and the remaining Coldsight forces seized the opportunity. Reorganized under the leadership of the new commander, Sacred Flame, they went on a large-scale offensive. From that moment on, SteelHooves had to forget about defeating them, returning to a grueling positional war.
Despite all the efforts the Watcher made to preserve the union of settlements, it suffered one defeat after another. When it became apparent that the nascent sprout of trust and mutual assistance had finally perished, he focused his efforts on helping other ponies, unknown here, and forces in other parts of Equestria. However, he did not forget about the two Stable Pi dwellers, whom he had noticed earlier. Both @lp and Velvet Remedy stay in touch with the Watcher, whom he helps cope with ordeals of the Wasteland, torn by brutal and meaningless wars.
@lp did everything she could trying to help the settlements fight the Enclave. Having made an invaluable contribution to the defense of each of her allies, she often fearlessly threw herself on the front line. However, the collapse of such a bright but short-lived union fell heavily on her heart. The hope that, as Calamity predicted, her example would form the basis of friendship between the settlements, had died, as well as the hope of saving ponies from many deaths in the war against the pegasi. Under a burden of realization of her being powerless to stop the massacre that began through her fault and to help her home, the soul of @lp gradually plunged into depression and despair. However, she is not so easy to break. Full of grim determination and bitterness, @lp continues fighting enemies, be it a pegasus, a slaver or a ranger. And nopony, even herself, can say why: in the name of redemption or in order to quench the flames growing inside her, flames of anger for this cruel, unjust and hopeless world.</n>
  </gui>
  <gui id="end_bad" v="0.8">
    <n>Despite her unwavering courage and the power of the armor created by Stable Pi scientists, @lp fell in an unequal battle against the Enclave soldiers. Her death in the battle for Stable Pi determined the outcome of the entire war. Without her help in battle with Thunderhead, the allies did not have enough strength to take over the air citadel, and they all were destroyed by the overwhelming firepower of the pegasi.
But this meant more than just losing Stable Pi. The retaliatory operation "Nemisis" provoked by the destruction of the research facility went ravaging through the surface of the Wasteland, destroying all noticeable islands of a newly emerging civilization. The "Prancing Pony" was turned to ashes, bases and fortresses of SteelHooves rangers after fierce but short-lived resistance fell one after another. All other major settlements within several hundred miles around also suffered from the ruthless anger of the Grand Pegasus Enclave, and their inhabitants died without even understanding what caused this act of revenge. When the pegasi returned behind the clouds, there was no pony left in the Wasteland who could rally the survivors, and the weak and scattered groups of ponies were torn apart one after another by raiders, slavers and creatures worse than them.
After a few years this entire area of ​​Equestria was almost completely devoid of intelligent life. Except for pegasi, whose research missions continued to study and plunder pre-war bases and warehouses, nopony else lived in these places...</n>

    <n>This is a list of all your weapons and magic. New weapons are indicated by the [☩] symbol.
Use [left mouse button] to equip the weapon. You can also use [mouse scroll] to change weapons in game without opening inventory.
Use [right mouse button] to remove weapons you are not going to use from the list, or to add them back to the list.
Hover over a list item and press [slot selection key] ([1] - [0], [-], [=]) to assign a weapon to the quick access slot, or to cancel the assignment. By pressing the same key in game, you can quickly equip this weapon.
You can also press the [slot selection key] together with the @1 key. Thus, the number of available slots increases from 12 to 24.
Hover over a grenade, mine, or attack spell and press @2 or @3 to designate them as additional weapons. Thus you will be able to use them together with a main weapon at any time using these keys. If no additional weapon is assigned, pressing the @4 key will use the last selected explosive, and the @5 key will activate the last selected combat spell.
In addition, you can assign a defensive spell to the quick spell slot using one of the [quick spell keys] (see control settings). By pressing the same key in game you can immediately apply the selected spell without having to equip it.
The right side of the screen shows weapon characteristics.
Damage: basic weapon damage (in parentheses is the actual damage that depends on your characteristics, in square brackets is the number of pellets for shotguns)
Damage per second: damage per second based on your characteristics (in brackets - approximate damage per second based on the time for reloading)
AP: action points for a shot at S.A.T.S. (in parentheses - the number of shots per burst shot in S.A.T.S. for automatic weapons)
Range: the distance in blocks at which the weapon will be guaranteed to hit the target. In reality this value is relative and depends on the weapon mastery skill and other factors

  <pip id="helpInv4" v="0.8">
    <n>This is a list of all the other things you have, such as valuable items, artifacts, quest items, schematics, components and other junk. These things are either used automatically or are useless and can be sold to merchants
</n>
  </pip>
  <pip id="helpInv5" s1="keyRun" v="0.8">
    <n>This is a list of all your ammunition and explosives. Ammunition suitable for the currently used weapon is located at the top of the list.
Use [left mouse button] to load the weapon with the necessary type of ammunition. You can also use [mouse scroll] along with the @1 key to change ammunition directly in game without opening inventory
</n>
  </pip>
  <pip id="massInv0" v="0.8">
    <n>In limited inventory mode, most items have weight. All your items are divided into categories, the weights for which are calculated separately</n>
  </pip>
  <pip id="massInv1" v="0.8">
    <n>[Weapons]
You can take with you and use a limited number of weapons determined by the number of [weapon slots]. Knives and pistols occupy one cell, rifles, shotguns etc. - two, and large-sized weapons - three. Grenades and mines can be used without restrictions. All other weapons are only available at the base camp.
Use [right mouse click] to discard a specific weapon and free the slots it occupies. The weapon will be hidden, will not occupy the weapon slots and you won`t be able to use it. You can still find the same weapon on a mission, or you can take it back when you return to the base camp using PipBuck or the weapon stand.
You can carry more weapons than you have weapon slots for, but it will slow you down. With a slight overload you will not be able to run and dash, with more overload you will only be able to trot, and finally you won`t be able to move at all. It will not affect movement speed in the base camp, but you won`t be able go anywhere else until you reduce weight.
[Magic]
You can use a limited number of attacking or defensive spells, all others will be unavailable. Each spell occupies one [magic slot], otherwise the principle is the same as for weapons.
Each extra spell will reduce the magic recovery speed by 25%</n>
  </pip>
  <pip id="massInv2" v="0.8">
    <n>[Armor]
You can take only one set of armor on a mission, the rest will remain in the base camp, except for protective suits and clothing. On a mission you can change into protective suits and clothing or back into the same armor any time.
Amulets can be changed at any time</n>
  </pip>
  <pip id="massInv3" v="0.8">
    <n>[Equipment]
This includes valuable and fragile items that you may need at any time (even in battle), which is why the inventory sorter puts them in a separate bag: medicine, potions, battle chemicals, StealthBucks, repair kits, runes. Each item has an arbitrary [weight] characteristic, which shows the space it occupies in the inventory.
If you take more items than the bag can carry, they might break when you take damage or simply fall out of the bag.
[Ammunition]
This includes all rounds, batteries and explosives. Due to the dangerous nature of these items and the need for quick access to reload weapons, the inventory sorter puts them in ammo pouches. They cannot be mixed with other items.
[Stuff]
Most of the other contents of your bags are sorted to the "stuff" category. This includes everything that should not necessary be close at hoof, regardless of a commercial value: food and drinks, books, memory orbs, items for sale, weapon components, armor plates, potion ingredients. Drinks and food can be consumed at any time, but you will have to return to base camp to read books and view memory balls, as those activities require time and a safe place.
Ammunition and stuff taken above limit will slow you down just like weapons. Overloads from inventory items of different categories do stack.
[Miscellaneous]
All items which weight is not taken into account. Quest objects, keys, tools (like a screwdriver), PipBuck implants and modules, artifacts, schematics, spray cans. They don`t take inventory space and cannot be laid out or discarded</n>
  </pip>
  <pip id='helpWorld' v='0.81'>
    <n>This is a world map, it displays all locations that you can visit. Locations can be of the following types:
[Base camps] - these are places where you don`t have to fight, instead you can trade, heal and take missions.
[Normal locations] - you can walk through and clear them once, enemies and items will not respawn in them. After completing main objectives in such locations, they are marked as "completed". But you can return to them at any time to open the remaining containers or find secrets.
[Generated locations] can be passed and cleared many times in order to earn experience and collect valuable items. Each time you enter them, they will have a new structures, enemies will respawn, and the containers will be untouched and full of various items. Also generated locations have special [trial rooms]. For completing the trials you will be rewarded with valuable items, and many [quest items] can also be found there.
Most generated locations have [levels]. At higher levels you will meet new interesting places, enemies and trials, as well as passages to new locations. To move to the next level, you must to go to the end of the location and enter the door with the [Exit] sign. In most cases, you will have to go through at least 2 or 3 levels deep for advancing further in the story. Also, clearing at least 25% of enemies replenishes the assortment of goods available at merchants in base camps.
You can go to any available location from the base camp using the wall map or the map in your PipBuck. If you teleport to the base camp from a generated location, use [MAS terminal] for returning to the previous location. If you try returning through the map, the location will be generated anew.
Remember, if you save the game while being in a generated location, then after loading you will find yourself in the base camp! Its current configuration will be lost, only the maximum level of location reached and the completed trials are saved</n>
  </pip>
  <pip id='helpSave' v='0.81'>
   <n>You can save the game in slots (10 slots + autosave slot) or into a file.
Saving the game to a file can be used to create backup copies of your saves or to transfer saves between different versions of the game. To save to a file use the [To file] button on the [Save] tab, and for loading use the [From file] button on the [Load] tab and select file location and name.

[Attention! Important!]
Des programmes de nettoyage peuvent supprimer les sauvegardes des slots ! Si vous utilisez ce genre de programme, faites des sauvegardes du jeu en utilisant le boutton [To file].
Il est d'ailleurs recommandé de sauvegarder de cette manière périodiquement juste au cas-où.</n>

      <r>[Megaspells] - ordinary spells strengthened by many orders of magnitude, which were used in the Great War as weapons of mass destruction</r>
      <r>[Balefire-bomb] - zebra megaspell base on the dragon fire, concealed in a special device. When activated, it explodes with a monstrous force that can destroy entire cities with a shock wave and poison the area with magical radiation</r>
      <r>[Pink cloud] - A terrible megaspell that destroyed the capital of Equestria, Canterlot. This is a deadly cloud of an extremely toxic gas of pink color, capable of killing all lifeforms. There is no protection from it</r>
      <r>[Stable-Tech] - a corporation that existed before the Great War. Known for building a variety of shelters-stables in which ponies were supposed to survive in the event of weapons of mass destruction going off</r>
      <r>[PipBuck] - a portable computer designed by Stable-tech, which ponies can wear on a front leg. It has many functions - tracking the health of the user, sorting inventory, mapping and navigation, viewing any files and keeping records</r>
      <r>[S.A.T.S.] - Stable-Tec Arcane Targeting Spell. A special spell built into PipBuck, which allows you to stop the subjective flow of time and help to aim from any weapon</r>
      <r>[Stable] - a fully autonomous underground shelter for ponies, designed for long-term use. During the War, more than a hundred stables were built, but most of them, for various reasons, are now abandoned, and all of their inhabitants died</r>

      <r>Six government organizations created during the Great War by the ruling princess Luna, whose common goal was to win the War and preserve the state integrity of Equestria. The ministries were ruled by the keepers of the Elements of Harmony.
[Ministry of Arcane Sciences], abbreviated [MAS] - a ministry headed by Twilight Sparkle. MAS was mainly engaged in the development of magical weapons and combat spells.
[Ministry of Image] is a ministry headed by Rarity. It was engaged in decorating streets, issuing printed materials, and also was responsible for censorship.
[Ministry of Peace] - Ministry headed by Fluttershy. It dealt with health issues, production of medicines such as medicinal potions, and helping wounded in combat. It is this ministry that is responsible for the invention of megaspells
[Ministry of Morale] is a ministry headed by Pinky Pie. Officially it took care of patriotic education, supporting the population morale and organization of holidays. Unofficially it was engaged in espionage and counterintelligence.
[Ministry of Wartime Technology] - the ministry headed by Applejack. It was engaged in development of the newest weapons and means of protection, such as power armor.
[Ministry of Awesome] - the ministry headed by Rainbow Dash. What exactly it did was not really known</r>

      <r>Soudain, votre PipBuck s'allume tout seul. Sur son écran l'interface habituelle est remplacée par une série de symboles, formant des mots et des phrases. Vous ne comprenez pas ce qui se passe, mais le logiciel PipBuck standard ne peut pas le faire et vous en êtes bien conscient</r>
      <r p='pip'>Salutation, "Chosen-25" @lp. Je suis le Mentor, ma tâche est de diriger vos actions et de montrer la voie</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Quoi?! Qu'est-ce que c'est maintenant? Qui me parle... et comment puis-je vous répondre ?</r>
      <r p='pip'>Maintenant, vous aimeriez probablement savoir qui je suis, comment je suis entré dans votre PipBuck et pourquoi vous devriez me faire confiance. Les questions sont plus que raisonnables et j'y répondrai bien sûr du mieux que je peux.
Pour l'instant, mon identité doit rester cachée. Une chose que je peux dire, c'est que nous nous connaissons bien, et je ne suis en aucun cas votre ennemi.
Ces messages ont été téléchargés à l'avance sur votre PipBuck et vous sont maintenant montrés. Et, si je devine juste ce que vous pensez maintenant - non, il n'y a pas de lien direct, vous ne pouvez pas répondre ou me poser des questions. Pour l'instant.
Quant à savoir pourquoi vous devriez me faire confiance, voici mon premier et principal argument</r>
      <r>Le PipBuck commence à lire un enregistrement audio. Étonnamment, vous reconnaissez votre propre voix </r>
      <r p='pip'>Salut, @lp du futur - dit @lp, c'est-à-dire toi, il y a quelques jours seulement. - Je t'ai laissé... je veux dire, moi-même... ce message, pour t'expliquer brièvement la situation. Parce qu'il y a quelque temps, tu t'es réveillé dans un endroit inconnu et avec un étrange vide dans ta mémoire. Et donc, puisque je sais que moi, c'est-à-dire que toi, ne croirais personne d'autre que toi-même, laisse-moi te dire ceci :
Moi, c'est-à-dire toi, tu es chargé d'une mission très importante. Vraiment important pour toute l'écurie, et moi, c'est-à-dire toi. Actuellement, tu es sous l'influence d'un sort bloquant certains de tes souvenirs. J'ai...tu as accepté de subir ce sort de manière absolument volontaire, sans la moindre contrainte ni menace. Je l'ai fait parce que c'était nécessaire. Fais-moi confiance... c'est-à-dire toi-même </r>
      <r p='pip'>Pour des raisons de sécurité, tu ne te souviendras plus où se trouve ta maison, tes amis et ta famille. Mais sache que c'est temporaire. Pour l'instant, suis simplement les instructions du Mentor, il te dira quoi faire. Il ne te mentira pas, je peux te l'assurer. Pendant que tu es en mission, ton nom de code est "Chosen-25". C'est tout. Bonne chance à toi </r>
      <r>L'enregistrement s'est terminé et de nouveaux messages sont apparus à l'écran</r>
      <r p='pip'>Eh bien, maintenant que nous avons terminé avec les questions principales, je vous envoie vos instructions. N'oubliez pas qu'il est dans votre intérêt de les exécuter dès que possible.
Bientôt, vous vous retrouverez dans un endroit appelé « le désert équestre ». Soyez extrêmement prudent, selon mes informations cet endroit est très dangereux. Vous pouvez rencontrer des poneys sauvages agressifs et des animaux mutants. Les zones contaminées par des rayonnements présentent également un danger. Essayez d'entrer en contact avec les habitants.
Vous recevrez le prochain message le moment venu. N'oubliez pas que votre tâche est très importante pour nous tous. Jusqu'à la prochaine fois, "Chosen-25" </r>
      <r>Les messages ont disparu et PipBuck est revenu à la normale. Dans la section "Quêtes", de nouvelles entrées sont apparues </r>
      <r p='lp2'>Je me souviens de mon écurie ! Je me souviens de quelque chose... vaguement... </r>
      <r p='lp5' push='1'>Argh!</r>
      <r p='lp3'>Un sort de mémoire ? Comment pourrais-je accepter cela? Mais c'était sûrement ma voix sur l'enregistrement, et si j'étais si confiant à ce sujet... Mentor, alors il devait y avoir une raison </r>
      <r p='lp1'>De toute façon, je n'ai pas vraiment le choix. Soit je resterai pour toujours dans cet endroit, soit je vais exécuter les instructions du Mentor, et puis nous verrons la suite </r>

      <r p='main'>Malheureusement oui. Nous avons beaucoup d'ennemis. Lorsque vous aurez terminé la mission et que vous reviendrez, je supprimerai le sort et les souvenirs vous reviendront. Mais pas avant. Vous avez vous-même accepté de telles conditions, n'est-ce pas ? </r>
      <r p='lp1'>Oui, j'ai entendu l'enregistrement. Mais cela ne facilite pas les choses !</r>
      <r p='main'>Je comprend... mais je sais que tu réussiras</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Mais peux-tu au moins me dire quelque chose sur le but de ma mission ? </r>
      <r p='main'>C'est la principale raison pour laquelle nous parlons en ce moment. Bien avant la fin de la guerre, Stable Pi était un refuge secret pour les scientifiques et les ingénieurs impliqués dans les études les plus importantes pour l'armée d'Equestria. Après la chute des bombes, nous sommes passés à une existence complètement autonome. L'ensemble du complexe Stable est profondément souterrain et vous ne trouverez l'entrée sur aucune carte. Le secret est très important pour nous. Nous ne sommes pas des guerriers, nous ne pouvons pas protéger nos précieuses connaissances de la cupidité des habitants des Terres Désolés. Par conséquent, nous ne contactons presque jamais le monde extérieur </r>
      <r p='lp1'>Je vois. Mais pourquoi aviez-vous besoin de m'envoyer à la surface ? </r>
      <r p='main'>L'un des derniers développements de Stable Pi avant le jour du jugement était le projet "Sun". Je ne peux rien vous dire à ce sujet, mais c'est extrêmement important non seulement pour notre petite société, mais pour l'ensemble d'Equestria. Malheureusement, à ce moment-là, le projet n'était pas terminé, car il était étroitement lié à un autre développement important - en même temps, les travaux sur le projet "Rainbow" étaient menés en parallèle dans les laboratoires ManeTec. Selon nos informations, ce deuxième projet était terminé, et l'ensemble des schémas et documentations techniques devait nous être transmis. Mais pour une raison quelconque, cela ne s'est jamais produit. Les lignes de communication avec leur maneframe ont survécu, mais le serveur n'a pas répondu à nos tentatives pour le faire fonctionner à distance </r>
      <r p='lp1'>Et c'est pourquoi vous aviez besoin que je remette ce serveur au travail ? Et pourquoi m'avez-vous appelé "Chosen-25" ? Et pourquoi m'aavez-vous envoyé ? Étais-je vraiment le meilleur choix pour une mission importante ? </r>
      <r p='main'>Le titre "Chosen" est une tradition. La première tentative d'envoyer un émissaire à la surface remonte à près de cent ans. Ensuite, il a été appelé « l'élu », car il a été élu parmi de nombreux autres candidats pour sa compétence. Il a été transféré dans les Terres Désolés par un sort de téléportation, mais il n'a pas rempli la mission et n'est pas revenu. Ensuite, nous en avons envoyé d'autres. Combattants et diplomates, forts et rusés, des équipes simples et entières. Il y avait donc "Chosen-2", "Chosen-3" et ainsi de suite. Personne n'a réussi. Mais toi. Alors oui, il s'est avéré que c'est toi qui étais le meilleur choix </r>
      <r p='lp4'>Eh bien, je suis contente d'avoir pu aider. Maintenant, je dois revenir ? </r>
      <r p='main'>Je suis désolé, @lp, mais non. L'obtention de fichiers était le premier objectif, mais pas le seul. Pour les projets "Sun" et "Rainbow", nous avons également besoin de certains composants que nous n'avons pas au Stable Pi. Vous devrez les obtenir. Nous avons besoin de temps pour étudier les schémas que nous avons reçus, mais l'un des composants manquants est déjà connu. C'est le Quantum Cogitor, et nous avons la preuve qu'il était stocké dans l'Étable 88 - l'Étable de recherche quelque peu similaire à la nôtre, mais avec beaucoup plus de ressources et axée sur la recherche dans le domaine de la robotique. Malheureusement, pour des raisons qui nous sont inconnues, après avoir scellé l'écurie, le canal de communication avec elle fut bientôt interrompu. Votre tâche est de vérifier l'état de l'écurie 88 et d'obtenir le cogitateur quantique des poneys qui l'habitent. L'entrée de l'écurie 88 est située à un endroit appelé Falls Springs</r>
      <r p='main' push='1'>Le chargement des fichiers est presque terminé, la connexion sera interrompue d'une minute à l'autre. Avez-vous d'autres questions? </r>
      <r p='lp2'>J'ai plein de questions, en fait. Que diriez-vous... </r>
      <r p='main'>Le transfert de fichiers est terminé. Connexion fermée </r>
      <r p='lp5'>Bon sang!</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Ça veut dire que je suis coincé ici depuis longtemps ? Et en plus, je dois encore risquer ma vie ? </r>
      <r p='lp3'>Mais "moi" du passé était confiante dans l'importance de cette mission. Suis-je alors au courant de ma future mission ? Que je devrais rester ici si longtemps ? </r>
      <r p='lp1'>Pourtant, même si je ne l'ai pas fait, cela ne veut pas dire que je dois tout abandonner. La tâche qui m'est confiée est extrêmement importante, et cela signifie que je dois la remplir. D'une façon ou d'une autre </r>

      <r p='calam'>Anyhow, she came here `bout three or four months ago. She was weak an` hungry, she almost went t` bed but stopped when she noticed Doc`s corner. He was fixin` a couple of our fellas shot by `em Raiders. So she went in, talked t` him about somethin` for `bout five minutes an` stayed t` help. Since then she was workin` with Doc. He praised her a lot, but between us he grumbled that our newcomer was tryin` t` give sick folks medications fer free</r>
      <r p='lp2'>And why she is not here anymore? Doctor Sepsis kicked her out?</r>

      <r p='lp2'>Look, Doc, we need to talk. It`s very important...</r>
      <r p='vd'>If it`s venereal, lets discuss your case behind this curtain</r>
      <r p='lp2'>No, it`s not that. I want to ask you about a Stable dweller. Did you know her? I was told that some time ago she was helping you here in the clinic</r>
      <r p='vd'>Ah, but of course, I remember her. Velvet Remedy - that was her name. Yes, she helped me here for a while. Very capable, and good in medicine, despite being self-educated. She learned from books, you can see it at once. Little practice, especially in surgery</r>
      <r p='vd'>But very kind, too much even. Wanted to help everypony for free. Not just ponies, every creature. We had a few quarrels with her about this, because her kindness made the clinic go into a negative balance. But we managed to find a compromise</r>
      <r p='vd'>She asked a lot about our life, but above all she was interested in ghouls. Tried to reveal a secret of their anti-life, did not believe my words that this is the black magic of zebras. As a result, she decided to get to the truth herself. Stupid idea, if you ask me. Ghouls can no longer be cured</r>
      <r p='vd'>First she was just searching for them around... I tried to dissuade her, but it was useless. Then she said that she found out where those creatures were most abundant. I guess, in some sewers or other forsaken hole. And then she just left and, well, that`s it. I haven`t seen her ever since</r>
      <r p='vd'>Pity... probably found more ghouls than it was necessary. Be careful, do not repeat her mistake</r>
      <r p='lp2'>And you did not even look for her?</r>
      <r p='vd'>We looked. Calamity flew around, even checked sewage pipes. We found no trace</r>
      <r p='lp3'>I see... Thank you</r>
      <r p='vd'>That was nothing... And why do you ask? Were you acquainted?</r>

      <r mod='1' m='1'>So, only a few hours passed after our conversation, and our glorious, shining, Hope of all Ponies, our Saviour, fuck-his-ass Red Eye has already got rid of me. Send to clear the old Stable? Seriously, bitch? Perhaps I should take a shovel myself, shouldn`t I, our dearest Rebuilder? I have never met such a vengeful bastard in my life. All right, fuck it. At least I`ll have some rest, while my guys have fun shooting at the tins|So, only a few hours passed after our conversation, and our glorious, shining, Hope of all Ponies, our Saviour, kiss-his-flank Red Eye has already got rid of me. Send to clear the old Stable? Seriously? Perhaps I should take a shovel myself, shouldn`t I, our dearest Rebuilder? I have never met such a vengeful bastard in my life. All right, screw it. Perhaps I`ll finally have some rest, while my guys have fun shooting at the tins</r>
      <r mod='1'>Day 1. My detachment gathered at dawn and went out through the northern gate. When I passed under the arch, I heard sentries giggling from the tower. These freaks lost all fear and continued laughing about my quarrel with the "red-eyed", even when I looked in their direction. I shot both of them, because you don`t mess with me. If anyone asks, I say that was for disrespecting the leader</r>
      <r mod='1'>Day 21. The usual routine was interrupted with the arrival of the Butch`s gang. The detachment was sent to prepare maps of underground sewers, and during that task they came across a lone unicorn, playing with some corpse in a dark corner. But this is not the main thing. The thing is that she has a PipBuck. Guards who caught her sincerely believe that this is a scribe of the Steel Rangers. I won`t make them doubt their beliefs, but my experience says something completely different. The Steel Rangers would never have sent out a lone unarmed scribe. In this world, there are only three types of ponies that have access to such rarities as PipBuck: Steel Rangers, elite Red Eye guards and habitants of the still closed Stables. The latter are so rare that many believe there are no functioning Stables at all, but our captive clearly does not belong to the first two categories. Nooo, she`s from a Stable! If so, then, it seems, I am the luckiest bastard from here to Canterlot itself. This little chick looks like she`s just out of a test tube, and she certainly won`t last long in our world. So her house must be very close. If I find an untouched Stable full of residents... this will be the biggest prize in my life!</r>
      <r mod='1'>Day 22. Yesterday I gave my guest a day to wrack her brain and tell me where her home is. Today the time is out, but she is deaf to the voice of reason. She claims that she "does not remember" this. Hah! Unfortunately, today she didn`t say anything important. We will continue our conversation tomorrow. But dear goddess, how sweetly she shouts under the blows of a whip...</r>
      <r mod='1'>Day 25. The prisoner is still silent. Choking in tears, assuring that she remembers nothing, but does not crack. Well, I`ll give her that, in her Stable they really know how to teach keeping their mouth shut. I`ll have to start searching myself. The problem is that among Butches guys there must be at least a pair of spies from my competitors. As soon as they find out that we have found a Stable, they run off the very same evening and report to their masters. Hence, we will support the myth of the Steel-ass`s scribe. I`ll put my most reliable guys at the head of the search teams, only they will know the real purpose of the search</r>
      <r mod='1' m='1'>Day 26. Escape of slaves. A newbie guards fell asleep at the post, and several fuckers escaped, including our tough chick. No longer I can hope learning about the Stable entrance from the first hooves. Both of the suckers were hanged at dawn, but what does it matter now? Now we have to rely only on luck and thorough search|Day 26. Escape of slaves. A newbie guards fell asleep at the post, and several captives escaped, including our tough chick.

      <r p='main'>Hush, do not shout, I just woke up! Do you even realize it`s two in the morning?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Forgive me, I did not follow the time while I was breaking through the huge Stable full of robots and slavers</r>
      <r p='main'>Full of what?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Just listen. A large group of ponies is operating here, in Stale 88, who catch and enslave other ponies</r>
      <r p='main'>I know who slavers are, @lp…</r>
      <r p='lp1'>.. which caught the Chosen-24 some time ago and went looking for our Stable</r>
      <r p='main'>Wait a minute. If there is a threat for the Stable Pi, we will have to take very strict security measures. Are you sure about what you are saying?</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Yes, absolutely. I read their orders. However, because of their paranoia, these guys kept the knowledge about our Stable secret which only their officers knew. I eliminated them</r>
      <r p='main'>Eliminated their officers? That is... impressive</r>
      <r p='main'>Nevertheless, @lp, with all due respect, I simply can not blindly trust your words. From this day I have no choice but to take additional precautions. For me and you this means that such communication sessions are no more acceptable</r>
      <r p='main'>So, do you have anything to say about your main assignment?</r>
      <r p='lp4'>I have the Cogitator</r>
      <r p='main'>Splendid! Well done, @lp</r>
      <r p='main'>So, the situation is as follows: the Cogitator is just one of several elements that we require. The two remaining: the Alicorn Amulet and the Black Book. Those are the ancient artifacts, which were studied before the war pony and were planned to be used in the "Rainbow" project. Both were far away from us in the day when the world was hit by mega-spells</r>
      <r p='main'>According to our archives, Alicorn Amulet was studied at the Research Institute of M.A.S. in Manehattan, while the Black Book was kept in Canterlot. They are your next goal. About the Cogitator - you need to give it to us. I`ll send you the coordinates and time for our next meeting, where a reliable... pony will be waiting for you. He will talk to you through the sprite-bot. Do not worry, you will immediately recognize that it is the one you need to talk to. He will take the cogitator from you, and then he will tell you whatever you want to know. We still can not let our secrets get into enemy hooves through you, but I think you deserve the right to learn more about your past</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Um, no! I`m going to get answers right...</r>

      <r p='ran1'>Hey, you!</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Easy now. I do not wish you any harm, er, metal ponies</r>
      <r p='ran1'>I will ask you questions, and you will answer them. Is this your sprite-bot?</r>
      <r p='lp2'>What? What do you mean?</r>
      <r p='ran1'>I asked you a question. We have a sprite-bot here in front of us. Is it yours?</r>
      <r p='lp2'>You are mistaken. I do not own any sprite bots</r>
      <r p='ran2'>Hold on, Rose. It seems that we have a misunderstanding</r>
      <r p='ran2'>Excuse my friend, little one. She did not mean to scare you</r>
      <r p='ran1'>What was that, Diamond?</r>
      <r p='ran2'>Be quiet</r>
      <r p='ran2' push='1'>Tell me, dear, where did you get this thing on your leg?</r>
      <r p='lp5'>Stop talking to me like this. And this "thing" belongs to me</r>
      <r p='ran2'>Sorry, little one, but you`re wrong. The fact is that such technologies are a legacy of ancient times. And we are Steel Rangers, a brotherhood whose duty is to preserve these technologies. Therefore, we, unfortunately, do not have the moral right to leave such an item in danger</r>
      <r p='ran2'>Besides, you`re not here by chance, are you? When we found this bot, it just hovered in one place, hiding in the bushes. Unusual behavior for a thoughtless machine, is it not? All the more unusual is that this robot tried to escape the very moment it spotted us. Somepony controlled this bot, and it was going to meet here with a certain pony, who was by chance passing by this abandoned, uninteresting place at this right moment. Do you understand what I mean, girl?</r>
      <r p='ran1'>In short - you are going with us. Now.</r>
      <r p='ran2'>Why so rude? Darling, once again please forgive rude Rose. We are not your enemies. But we must take you to our home, where you will give us your PipBuck and tell us where you got it from and who controlled the sprite-bot. This way you will do everypony great favor, I assure you! And for this, we will treat you well and give you supplies for the journey. Deal?</r>
      <r p='lp5'>I`d say this was the most unusual attempt to rob me as long as I can remember. No, I`m not going anywhere with you, and I am not giving you my PipBuck. Do you understand?</r>
      <r p='ran2'>Yes, wanderer. We understood</r>

My group was reassigned to strengthen the main detachments of catchers, and the supervision of the territory was entrusted to you.

You may think I`m fucking with you - you can leave everything, run to the headquarters and show her to Tweak, I`be happy to watch as he kicks your butt for "insubordination." I`m serious, buddy, no lies now.
You were not at the briefing of the rear-guard commanders, so I`ll give you the short version. We do not really expect anyone, but just in case everypony should watch out for the Steel-asses. These shit-mashers got a habit of sending spies to the places of our operations. Personally I give them no shit, but this kind of surveillance makes the employers nervous. Therefore, it is ordered to shoot every bitch on sight. It is simple to tell one: these gear-fuckers never, under no circumstances refuse to let go of PipBucks. It contradicts their principles or something. So just tell your guys to make holes in everypony who has such a gadget on his leg. And do not kill anypony by mistake, the employer needs locals alive. The convoy will be sent to you from time to time to pick up those ponies that you catch on the perimeter, so you don`t have to separate the group.

      <r p='calam'>No, they appeared there only recently. The main problem is not even them. The Stable is full of `em robots. Stable 88 is abandoned, an` no pony knows how long it`s been like that. Maybe they built it that way from the beginnin`, without ponies. Ah don`t know... it`s just rumors.

Ya come straight to the main gate - ya get a dozen extra holes in yer body. But ya can try t` enter through the sewers. One runaway slave told me that he had escaped this way.

      <r p='calam'>Well, good luck then! If ya manage to get into that Stable under slavers` nose... Oh yeah, that will be some news! Many folks here will sure ask ya t` bring some things from there. Ya can make good money, ya know</r>

      <r p='calam'>Here you are, @lp!</r>
      <r p='lp2'>You were waiting for me?</r>
      <r p='vb'>Of course! You don`t meet a pony every day, who manage to kick slavers` flanks!</r>
      <r p='calam'>After yer askin` `bout Falls Springs, Ah was worried `bout ya, @lp. Ah decided to fly an` look in case ya got in the hooves of `em freaks. But what Ah found was a bunch of corpses and empty cages. Ah reckon ya really know how t` stand up for yourself</r>
      <r p='vb'>And you didn`t just shoot a bunch of bad ponies, @lp. This group could threaten our camp. And my experience says that if it were not for you and your courage, in the near future we would surely have to stain our hoofs with their blood. Or try on slave chains</r>
      <r p='vb'>As the head of this settlement, I can not leave your action unnoticed. For help in dealing with slavers threat, you deserve a good reward</r>
      <r p='lp4'>Thanks for this. But, to be honest, I did it primarily for my own purpose, not out of altruism. Do not waste you compliments on me</r> 
      <r p='calam'>Oh, by the way. Have ya achieved yer goal, @lp? Unless, ya know, it`s secret</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Yes, it`s alright, I got what I needed from there. But now it seems that I need to go even further</r>
      <r p='calam'>Oh yeah? An` where now?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Manehattan</r>
      <r p='vb'>Don`t</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Why?</r>
      <r p='vb'>Except that it`s quite far? Red Eye and the Goddess are having a big hunt there now. Poor local ponies are chased like animals and taken to Fillydelphia</r>
      <r p='calam'>@lp, I know that ye`re used t` dealin` with slavers now, but there everythin` is different. There are more of `em, and Talons and alicorns will join `em</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Honestly, I don`t even know who those ponies are</r>
      <r p='vb'>Oh, you stable ponies...</r>
      <r p='calam'>Ayep</r>
      <r p='calam'>I`ll explain, @lp. Talons are not ponies, they are griffins. Have ya heard of such creatures?</r>
      <r p='lp3'>I recall something...</r>
      <r p='calam'>So, Talons are griffin mercenaries. Ah don`t know how t` say this, but... they live a different life. An` have other principles. In general they are like normal folks, but instead of conscience they have contracts. Who pays `em - that`s their friend. An` now they are paid by Red Eye</r>
      <r p='calam'>They`ve been mercenaries for decades, an` they`ve earned lots of caps fer their work. An` they spend these caps t` buy the most deadly guns in the entire Equestrian Wasteland. Thus fightin` even one of `em is a risky business. An` there will be a whole battalion</r>
      <r p='vb'>But even they are not as dangerous as alicorns</r>
      <r p='vb'>In fact, little is known about what they actually are. They look like the Princesses, but they have nothing to do with them. They are ruthless, arrogant and selfish. And they are extremely strong in magic</r>
      <r p='vb'>But that`s not all. I have no idea how, but they are constantly connected with each other telepathically. They call this "Unity" and aim to forcibly "unite" everypony they capture. It is ruled by a certain Goddess, she tells the others what to do, commanding from somewhere deep inside the old Mariponi base</r>
      <r p='calam'>An` they are partners with Red Eye, so her alicorns are now helping slavers</r>
      <r p='calam'>An` here`s a cherry on top: ponies that were rescued from Manehattan say they saw a particularly large alicorn. They say it`s scary like an eternal night, an` deadly like a pack of hellhounds</r>
      <r p='calam'>Do you still want t` go there?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>No. I don`t want to go at all. But I must</r>
      <r p='vb'>Still going, huh? Pity. Well, then I can only wish one thing, @lp. Good luck out there</r>
      <r p='calam'>Right. Good luck, @lp. Come back in one piece</r>
      <r p='calam'>An` here, take this. Yer goin` t` need it in Manehattan</r>

      <r p='lp1'>Calamity, I`ve long wanted to ask one thing. Who is this Red Eye?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I`ve already heard about him several times, including from you, but I still do not know anything except that he is the leader of slavers</r>
      <r p='calam'>Ayep, that`s right. He actually commands `em bastards</r>
      <r p='calam'>But he not jus` orders `em to grab everypony and send `em to Fillydelphia. He seriously believes that he saves folks. Builds a new world. Well, or he says so</r>
      <r p='calam'>He has a base in Fillydelphia, or rather a whole city. Slaves work there `til they die, building factories in which they then build weapons fer Red Eye`s armies. They say the city`s grown really big, but Ah`ve never been there</r>
      <r p='calam'>An` every day he rubs his ideas into folks brains `bout how they must suffer fer the sake of their children`s future</r>
      <r p='calam'>It`s all bullshit, @lp. What future can be built on bones? Slaves die for his ideas, an` his slavers are merely bandits. That ain`t how ya build the future</r>
      <r p='calam'>But there are those who believe him. That`s how he gets new recruits fer his army. And he recruits often, `cuz normal ponies greet his jerks with a bullet between eyes</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Yes, now everything got clearer. Thank you, Calamity</r>
      <r p='lp5'>I`ll try teaching his acolytes some manners</r>
      <r p='calam'>Don`t ya get carried away, @lp. The least of all Ah want is fer ya t` be killed or taken into slavery</r>
      <r p='calam'>Yeah, one more thin`: in his speeches he often brags that he came outta Stable. T` be honest, there are not many intact Stables left now. Did anypony leave yer Stable durin` last ten years? Besides ya, `f course</r>
      <r p='lp2'>I have no idea. He`s from the Stable, you say?</r>

      <r p='lp4'>Hi Calamity</r>
      <r p='calam'>It`s good t` see ya, @lp. I almost lost hope that ya come back.
However`s that lil business of yours?</r>
      <r p='lp4'>Better than it could be</r>
      <r p='calam'>It`s done? No more jumpin` into the jaws of danger?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I`m afraid that it`s not quite finished. Now I need to visit Canterlot</r>
      <r p='calam'>Canterlot?..
There are easier ways t` die, ya know. What business brings ya t` Canterlot?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I`m doing this for my Stable. Believe me, this is really important</r>
      <r p='calam'>Ah hoped Ah wouldn`t hear that again.
Are you sure about this?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>...</r>
      <r p='lp1' push='1'>I am</r>
      <r p='calam'>Suit yerself. But Ah can`t help ya here. Not at all.
Myself Ah`ve never been t` those parts before. Ah only know what others say. An` they say lil</r>
      <r p='lp1'>In any case, I know less than you do. Tell me what you know about Canterlot, maybe that will save my life there</r>
      <r p='calam'>Well, listen then.
Ah was told many horrible stories about this city. Before the war, it was our capital, Celestia and Luna lived there. Well, zebras reserved for it the most filthy thin` they could. Some kind of fierce gas, which is called the Pink Cloud. It kills very quickly, worse, melting and fusing everything it touches</r>
      <r p='lp2'>"Fusing"?</r>
      <r p='calam'>Ayep. Ya know, there were two things - now there`s one. Ya are carryin` yer PipBuck thingy on yer leg, boom - it`s stuck to ya, so that ya can`t put it off without tearing it apart from yer own meat. I don`t know whether this is jus` a story t` scare foals or not, but Ah wouldn`t test it.
Ah don`t know what exactly happened, but there`s lots of this Cloud there. An` I did not hear `bout anypony returnin` from Canterlot. Unless they jus` peeked inside and quickly got outta that place</r>
      <r p='calam'>Ah also heard there are ghosts, souls of the dead ponies. They died in such a horrible way that they can no longer leave our world, an` now they live there, in Canterlot. An` their only joy is to take somepony fresh with `em. An` they really can!</r>
      <r p='calam'>Ah can`t tell ya exactly how t` get there. Ah know that Canterlot is far t` the North from us. Ah reckon, all roads should lead there, since it was the capital. So in your place, Ah would jus` find a major highway t` the north and walk along it, until Ah found something t` guide mahself further</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I think your advices will help me a lot, Calamity. Thank you</r>
      <r p='calam'>@lp?
Ya shouldn`t go there, ya know? Ah don`t know what`s goin` on there with your Stable, but no pony should risk their lives that much. Ya can stay with us, folks will be happy to let ya in. Ya`ll join the patrol, or become apprentice to Winry, maybe open yer business even. Ya`re a good gal, everypony can see that. Jus` stay</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I will stay with you. Someday. But not now. I can not give up my mission now</r>
      <r p='calam'>Ya shouldn`t do this, @lp. It`s yer decision, `fcourse, but Ah say ye`re makin` a mistake. At least tell me, what is that ye`re fightin` for?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Sorry, Calamity. I just can`t. It`s how it should be</r>
      <r p='calam'>Well then, good luck to ya. Again</r>
      <r p='lp2'>One last question.
"I hoped I wouldn`t hear that again". What was that about?</r>
      <r p='calam'>Ah don`t know mahself. Don`t ya mind</r>

      <r p='ze1'>Do not threaten us, stranger. There is just one of you and five of us. You would be better off if everypony just went their own way</r>
      <r p='lp1'>If this is another trick, you`ll regret it. Where are you going?</r>
      <r p='ze2'>Ponies are not friends with the Legion, therefore you are no enemy to us. We are going home. Do ponies kill those who return home?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Legion? What is that?</r>
      <r p='ze1'>Our enemy, and yours as well. Zebras, trapped in the past and still fighting the War that ended two hundred years ago. They kill ponies without warning</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Yes, I`ve met those before. Frankly, because of them, I expected you to attack me. I`m glad you are different</r>
      <r p='ze1'>Zebra should not be enemies of ponies. We fought before, and what have we achieved? We always welcome new friends in these lands. And we learned that you, ponies, can respond to hospitality with kindness</r>
      <r p='ze2'>In fact, we recently met a very kind pony. The black mare saved lives of two of our brothers, and then came with them to our home and now saves even more lives. If it was not for her, we would have to say farewell to many zebras</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Black pony? Does she by any chance have a device like this one on my leg?</r>
      <r p='ze2'>Yes, she wears the same one. Do you know each other?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I have to speak with her. Please, take me to your home</r>
      <r p='ze1'>We will take you with us, stranger. But know that we will not let you hurt her. Do not even try</r>

      <r p="lp2">So, this is your settlement? Looks... modest</r>
      <r p="ze1">We have to survive in difficult conditions. However, in this northern wilderness there is little risk of encountering soldiers of the Legion</r>
      <r p="lp1">Do they bother you?</r>
      <r p="ze1">Fortunately, no. We are considered traitors and criminals, and they will kill us at the first sight without any warning. Therefore, we are forced to hide. But in their eyes we are nothing more than an annoying insect - and as long as they have more important problems, they will not be looking for us. However when the Legion decides to come, we will be discovered, sooner or later</r>
      <r p="lp1">Then, perhaps you should go further to the North?</r>
      <r p="ze1">There is no use hiding from scouts and spies of the Legion. And if we go north, we will move further away from the sources of food and supplies known to us. We are not the only zebras who hide from the the Legion. But neither we nor other settlements have so far been able to find anything worthwhile to the north of Canterlot. There is nowhere to go</r>
      <r p="lp1">And how are you going to live then?</r>
      <r p="ze1">More or less the way we live now. At least they are not trying to kill use here. That`s already something</r>

      <r p='vel'>Have we met?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Sometime in the past - probably. In the present - not yet.
I am Chosen-25. My name is @lp. I was sent to finish the mission that you were sent to execute. Glad to finally meet you</r>
      <r p='vel'>Poor child...
They erased your memory as well, didn`t they?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>That`s right</r>
      <r p='vel'>And sent to get some data to the old factory?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Yes, they did</r>
      <r p='vel'>I hope you were smart enough not to do this?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I found the data and gave it to the Mentor. I also received new assignments from him, and one of them leads me to Canterlot</r>
      <r p='vel'>Holy Celestia...
Do you have any idea what you`re doing? Did you learn anything about the project?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>No, it was deleted right after I sent it to Stable</r>
      <r p='vel'>Then there`s still a chance to bring you to reason.
You should not help those ponies, you see? What Mentor is looking for is a weapon, and this weapon will only bring pain to this world. Even more pain</r>
      <r p='lp2'>How do you know?</r>
      <r p='vel'>I saw the notes. I read them. The "Sun" project has only one goal - destruction. The weapon of such power can not do any good</r>
      <r p='lp5'>Any weapon can be used for protection or at least a warning</r>
      <r p='vel'>Look around, @lp. See? These are the consequences of a "warning". Once ponies thought that the more guns they had, the safer they would be. Now a handful of their descendants survive on the charred remains of what those ponies called home.
Even if this so-called "Mentor" believes in good intentions of this project, the result will still be the same. And Stable Pi will rot with everything it touches</r>
      <r p='vel'>This world and those ponies do not need any more weapons, @lp. They need to live. Live and prosper. Isn`t this our task? We must be helping those poor ponies, zebras and other races that live here, not killing them</r>
      <r p='lp5'>Not all ponies are ready to accept help, Velvet. Can`t you see this? You were a prisoner of slavers, you know that! How did they treat you? How do they deal with all who fall into their hooves? Get rid of weapons, and you`ll spend your last days in slave chains!</r>
      <r p='vel'>There are other ways to protect yourself and without the "Sun" project, @lp. For centuries Stable Pi lived without it, it will live on for centuries. The Mentor only makes it worse for us and for themselves, trying to complete this sinister project of the past</r>
      <r p='lp1'>You just brush off all Mentors arguments. But why don`t you think that this weapon might be intended for some higher purpose? What do you really know about its potential use? Those schemes said nothing about this, did they?</r>
      <r p='vel'>Yes, they did not. But weapons can have only one purpose - to kill. And no matter how much its owners pretend to be defenders, sooner or later they too become murderers. There are no other options in this goddesses-forsaken world. I`ve been here longer than you, @lp, I know this. I see it every day. The Mentor will end up the same way, and drag others along with him</r>
      <r p='lp1'>And what if everything is different? What if the weapon helps defeating the evil of this world? Defeat the Red Eye, defeat the Goddess? Wouldn`t this make Equestria better? Just imagine that the ponies you are helping will no longer face the fate of dying in slavery or becoming alicorns. Is it not worth fighting for?</r>
      <r p='vel'>You are very naive, @lp. All the weapons, every carbine and knife that were created in Equestria were made for the same purpose that you are talking about now. For the sake of protection. And each time they failed and made things only worse</r>
      <r p='lp1'>But this time we know the price of the mistake, Velvet! This time we understand what we are fighting for and what we want to prevent. Those ponies that lived then did not know this. And so they died.
I believe the Mentor. I believe that he understands what he wants to achieve. Understands much better than me or you. And that he will do no evil</r>
      <r p='vel'>I can not agree with you, @lp. You have your own truth, I have mine. I can only hope that you are right, and I am not, because I won`t be able to stop you if everything goes wrong and not as you planned. But I will ask you about one thing.
Promise me that if the Mentor turns not to be who you expect him to be, you will not let him do anything wrong to Equestria</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I promise. I know that he won`t do anything wrong, but I promise you</r>
      <r p='vel'>Thank you, @lp</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I am glad I found you, Velvet. After all, we are from the same Stable. It means a lot to find a pony that can understand you</r>
      <r p='vel'>From the same Stable. With the same story. They erased our memory in order to protect themselves from threats, then ruthlessly thrown us out to face them. Now few things could really surprise us, don`t you think?</r>

      <r p='lp1'>Like I said, now I`m heading to Canterlot. Do you know anything about that place?</r>
      <r p='vel'>I still insist that you should forget about your mission, @lp. If not for the sake of ridding the world of a potential threat, then at least for you own safety</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I will not give up on my goal, Velvet. I`m sorry</r>
      <r p='vel'>Alright, I`ll accept your position</r>
      <r p='vel'>Zebras living here sometimes wander into Canterlot. It is very dangerous, but if you know where the threat comes from, there is a chance to return from there alive.
Ask the Zambezi about this, she has already been to the city several times. Sometimes the need of survival can make you take a terrible risk</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Thank you. But can you tell me more about this settlement?</r>
      <r p='vel'>Of course.
Covertsign is the refuge of those zebras that rejected the call of the Legion. The zebras of the Legion hate ponies with all their heart and believe that they must destroy us all. They require each zebra to stand under its banner in this holy war. If some zebras refuse, they becomes the same enemy of the Legion as ponies</r>
      <r p='vel'>Covertsign is their hideout, here Legion won`t find them. But it is very difficult to survive in this wilderness. Many get sick, the whole camp is forced to starve from time to time. They get the necessary resources either by long trips to abandoned cities, or extremely dangerous raids into Canterlot. But few dare to take the second option, and those who do are considered as heroes</r>
      <r p='vel'>I came here when I met a group of local zebras that explored the ruins of Manehattan. They needed medical attention, which they had nowhere to get from. I helped them to reach their home, and now here I am treating all those in need. They need help much more than some other ponies</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Thank you, Velvet. Perhaps I will also be able to help them with something</r>
      <r p='vel'>That would be great</r>

      <t v="0.8">Zambezi about Canterlot</t>
      <r p='lp1'>Hello!</r>
      <r p='zetr'>Good day to you, traveler. My name is Zambezi. And what is your name?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>@lp. Nice to meet you. I was told that you are the zebra who knows about dangers of Canterlot more than anypony else</r>
      <r p='zetr'>This is true, I will not deny it. I made many journeys to the Damned City. Does your path lead to the very same walls?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Unfortunately it does. I really need to get to Canterlot. Can you help me?</r>
      <r p='zetr'>Knowledge is a great power, and usually it is not received for free. But those who try to profit from those in desperate need will be cursed by the spirits of their ancestors for ever and ever. I will tell you everything I know, @lp, and I will not ask a single cap for it. Listen carefully</r>
      <r p='zetr'>Once upon a time zebras and ponykind began a war among themselves. Small at first, their discord grew every year, and no one could extinguish this fire, until the world was burned to the ground in flames of anger and fear. When this happened, the strongest zebra shamans resorted to the most terrible spells that exist in this world - necromancy</r>
      <r p='zetr'>They created a magical gas called the Pink Cloud and placed it into amulets, from which it was flowing as an endless stream. These amulets were secretly hidden in the bowels of the capital of ponykind, and when the hour came, the mighty clouds of pink death burst into streets of the city.
But those who were unlucky to get into these clouds rarely found peace. And after death they are doomed to rise again and again, wandering aimlessly through the streets that once were familiar to them. If you are unlucky enough to encounter these poor souls, make sure that their body is no longer able to rise</r>
      <r p='zetr'>But not only these poor ponies will threaten you there. So strong was hatred of shamans who created the Pink Cloud, that it still lives in the shadows of the castles and palaces of the Damned City. Breathing it means death, but even the best mask will not protect you from it, and armor will only cause your demise. Everything that the cloud touches merges together, and so your armor will bite into your body and will never let go. If you have to go into these cursed clouds, take off everything that is unnecessary and keep away from your body</r>
      <r p='zetr'>In some places the Pink Cloud became so dense that it turned liquid or almost solid state. Do not even think about stepping on those lumps of pink slime, as they will burst under your feet like an overripe mutafruit. And then you will get to know all the dark power of the Cloud like in the day it was released into our world</r>
      <r p='zetr'>The darkest spawn of the Cloud are the necrosprites. Once you see them, you will remember their shapeless appearance until the end of your days. The black haze that came to life by an evil trick and set off to kill. Do not even try to defeat them with a usual weapon - it will pass through the darkness as if you are trying to cut trough the shadow. The only thing that can cleanse this dark spawn is magic, otherwise you will have no choice but to run and not look back, as far as your hooves will carry you</r>
      <r p='zetr'>The dark magic of the Cloud influenced even inanimate objects. Technical devices from old times, such as loudspeakers and radio, themselves became transmitters of evil power. They fill streets with hymns of insanity and death, and if you hear them - destroy the source without approaching it or just leave and do not return</r>
      <r p='lp2'>What, the whole place is a deathtrap? Is there anything that doesn`t threaten with a quick death?</r>
      <r p='zetr'>One more thing, a new threat appeared recently in the Cursed City. Pale resemblances of your ancient Goddesses, creatures with wings and horns roam ancient ruins and catacombs. Dim shadows on the walls betray their presence, and terrible fate awaits those who will not notice the danger. I can not tell what motivates them, but I would not try to talking to these corrupted creatures</r>
      <r p='lp2'>It`s... a lot to think about. Perhaps now I want to go there even less</r>
      <r p='zetr'>Only a great need can push ponies and zebras to come to that place. If your goal is so important, for its sake you will have to enter the jaws of the Abyss</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I was not going to give up. Thank you, Zambezi. Just tell me one more thing: what`s the fastest way to get to Canterlot?</r>
      <r p='zetr'>The easiest way to get in there is by the old road to the North of the city. To reach it go East from here for half an hour. Then turn right along the road, and if you leave now, by the end of the day you will see the domes of Canterlot</r>
      <r p='lp4'>Thanks again!</r>

      <r p="lp1">Hey, Velvet! What happened to this zebra, is she sick?</r>
      <r p="vel">This is Zira. Yes, I`m afraid she has some kind of fever. For several days she remains unconscious, and I can`t do anything. Apparently, my knowledge of medicine is still not enough...</r>
      <r p="lp1">Mind if I have a look?</r>
      <r p="vel">If you`re trained in medicine, then of course. Perhaps you can at least help to make the right diagnosis</r>
    </n>
  </txt>
  <txt id="dialPatient2" v="0.7">
    <n>
      <r>You examine the sick zebra, but, apart from the fever and rapid breathing, you do not see any particular symptoms. Your knowledge of medicine is clearly not enough here</r>
    </n>
  </txt>
  <txt id="dialPatient3" v="0.7">
    <n>
      <r>You examine the sick zebra and notice a number of characteristic symptoms. Tons of medical journals you read gave you the opportunity to recollect some rare diseases, match the symptoms and establish a diagnosis</r>
      <r p="lp1">I think I know what`s wrong with her. By all symptoms it appears to be a dusty fever</r>
      <r p="vel">Hmm... Yes, perhaps you`re right. But this is a very rare disease, how... well, doesn`t matter. If so, then there is no chance curing her with potions or spells. Only the vaccine will help, but I have no idea where to get it. You see, everything that we have at our disposal is old pre-war reserves and potions of our own production</r>
      <r p="lp3">Perhaps Doc Sepsis can help?</r>
      <r p="vel">May be. At least we can`t find a better doctor anyway. I understand, @lp, that you have a lot to do, but if you could...</r>
      <r p="lp4">Of course, Velvet, no problem. I`ll pay Doc a visit as soon as possible</r>
      <r p="vel">Hurry, please. I don`t known how much time she has</r>

  <txt id="dialPatient4" v="0.7">
    <n>
      <r p="lp1">Hi, Doc. There is a very urgent matter</r>
      <r p="vd">Speak. Somepony needs help?</r>
      <r p="lp1">Yes. One... pony... has a dust fever. I need a vaccine, otherwise...</r>
      <r p="vd">Otherwise it dies. I see. But are you sure that it has this disease? It is quite rare</r>
      <r p="lp1">All symptoms confirm so</r>
      <r p="vd">"All symptoms"? So you decided to become a doctor now? Do you realize that this is not stuff to play with? The very life of a pony depends on your decision, and if you misdiagnose the disease, the patient can easily die, while you wonder why your treatment didn`t work</r>
      <r p="lp1">Doc, I understand that this is serious and I don`t have proper education to qualify for the doctor degree. However, I spent quite a long time studying materials on medicine, and the symptoms of the patient exactly match with the description of dusty fever: the patient has some lacrimation, reddening of the mucous membrane of the eye and inflammation of the eyelid, as if from sand, although examination for foreign objects under the eyelids and in the eye corners gave no results. The temperature is noticeably higher than usual catarrhal temperatures and rather indicates a viral infection, but there is no sweating characteristic for such diseases, and...</r>
      <r p="vd">Alright, enough. If these are real symptoms, then I agree, most likely, the patient really has a dusty fever. I can not say anything for sure without a personal examination, but this time I trust your observations</r>
      <r p="vd" push="1">Five thousand caps</r>
      <r p="lp2">Wow! Isn`t this too much?</r>
      <r p="vd">I got one ampoule of this vaccine for four thousand five hundred caps from a passing by travelling merchant, and I bought it, not knowing if I ever have patients with such a disease at all. And all this time I kept it in appropriate storage conditions, which, by the way, consume electricity. And the fuel for generators is not free, you know. So better say "thank you" for selling you medicine almost at cost price and not mentioning your income from selling goods you bring from pre-war ruins</r>
      <r p="lp2">For goddesses` sake! Alright, give me the vaccine, I`ll pay</r>

  <txt id="dialPatient5" v="0.7">
    <n>
      <r>You inject patient with a vaccine and almost immediately notice positive changes. Her breathing becomes even and deep, and the heat subsides. It seems that the crisis has passed and now she will cure</r>
      <r p="lp4">That`s better, Zira, get well soon. What a pleasant feeling when you help others!</r>

      <r p="vel">Yes! Most likely, she will have to stay in bed for a long time, but the danger has passed, there is no doubt about it. And it`s all thanks to you!</r>
      <r p="lp4">Please, it was nothing</r>
      <r p="vel">No, @lp! To save somepony`s life is not "nothing"! In fact, at our first meeting you seemed to me no better than most of the wasteland inhabitants, who only know how to take a life. But you proved that you are capable of more</r>
      <r p="vel">Here, I have a little present for you. This is the figure of the best pony, whose kindness and compassion knew no boundaries - Fluttershy, the head of the Ministry of Peace. May she always be with you, just as she is with me...</r>

      <r p="zira">I don`t know what to say. I am surprised!
Here at Covertsign we always help each other. It should be like that, we cannot survive without it. But we live together. We are all together. And you... just a passer-by</r>
      <r p="lp2">Well, it`s just that since I could help, why should I not?</r>
      <r p="zira">What is that to you? You helped without getting anything in return. In our world this can turn out badly, everypony knows that. It`s not easy to survive, every little thing is valuable. You and your friend are so... amazing! Yes, amazing.
If you were stupid that would be understandable. But stupid ponies do not live long</r>
      <r p="zira">Velvet told us many things. About how the world used to be, that we need needs to help others. I don`t know, I don`t think that you can live like that now. But the two of you managed somehow.
Thanks for help. For helping me, even though you didn`t know me at all. And that you live not like we live. You and Velvet... I do not understand you, but I enjoy seeing that you manage living like this</r>
      <r p="lp1">I don`t know if my answer helps, I`m just glad to see that somepony feels better. Somepony who doesn`t ruin lives of other ponies. Or zebras</r>
      <r p="zira">I do not know you, perhaps I never will. But Velvet said the same thing. In this you are similar</r>

      <r p='lp2'>That`s right. What ponies like you seek in Canterlot?</r>
      <r p='sh'>Ponies like us? Sounds like you`ve met our comrades before, haven`t you?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I have. Unfortunately, we did not get along very well</r>
      <r p='ran2'>Permission to speak, Star Paladin? As far as I can tell, it is the pony that killed Riven Diamond and Scarlet Rose</r>
      <r p='sh'>Really? Is that true, stranger?</r>
      <r p='lp2'>What? No! That`s not what I meant when I said...</r>
      <r p='ran2'>I saw her on a video recording from the Scarlet Rose`s armor. There can be no mistake</r>
      <r p='lp5'>Just try doing something!..</r>
      <r p='sh'>Don`t rush to conclusions. We are not your enemies, unlike you probably think</r>
      <r p='sh'>Knights that you killed have long been a problem. Moreover, they were active supporters of our Elder, Coldsight. I can not approve killing members of the brotherhood, but it turned out that in view of... a current situation inside our division, your actions have brought more benefit than damage</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I see you have a difficult relationship with your brethren</r>
      <r p='sh'>Indeed. By the way, what is your name, stranger?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>My name is @lp</r>
      <r p='sh'>Pleased to meet you. My name is SteelHooves, I am the Star Paladin of Steel Rangers, Neighara`s Division. My brethren, whom you see before you - Green Wire, Groundshire and Great Gage. It so happened that at the moment me and my supporters among the rangers are in... opposition to the most others</r>
      <r p='sh'>We do not fight like you, common ponies, are used to do. However, unfortunately, ideological differences may often cause misunderstanding and confrontation. At the moment, enemy of Coldsight may be our friend. Providing she agrees to cooperate</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Depending on what you mean by "cooperation"</r>
      <r p='sh'>Let`s start with what you are seeking in this city. I visit this place not for the first time, maybe I can help you in your search</r>
      <r p='lp4'>Unless it is some kind of trick, it would be really nice of you. I need to know the location for the head office of the Ministry of Image</r>
      <r p='sh'>No problem. Just move along this street, then turn left at the first crossing and after three blocks you will get to the main city avenue. Follow it, and after some time you will reach the Ministry Mall. The Ministry of Image is there</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Thank you for the hint. I hope it will help</r>
      <r p='sh'>Our group is now returning to our camp after the last raid. If you are interested in continuing our cooperation, you are welcome to visit us. At the moment we are based in an old water treatment plant south of the city, five miles by walking along the Ponyville railroad</r>

      <t v="0.8">SteelHooves gives a mission</t>
      <r p='lp3'>Why are you here anyhow?</r>
      <r p='sh'>There is no secret - we are here for the sake of secrets that remained hidden by the Cloud in this city after the War</r>
      <r p='sh'>Until the Last Day, numerous scientific and technological projects thrived in Equestria. They were divided between several large organizations. One of such organizations was the Stable-Tec corporation.
This corporation was primarily concerned with the creation of the Stables - capacious and incredibly protected underground shelters, the purpose of which was to save the lives of ponies from mega-spells. However, Stable-Tec was also engaged in scientific activities, usually associated with living underground.
One such project was the creation of industrial hydroponic farms</r>
      <r p='sh'>Such farms would allow cultivation of various plants without needing natural soil and sunlight. This development was much more promising than artificial orchards that were introduced in most Stables as the main source of food, but the final tests were not completed</r>
      <r p='sh'>We learned about existence of this project from computer logs in other Stable-Tec offices, but this research was done in the Canterlot branch of the corporation, so detailed data on the farms and the coordinates of their testing site can only be found here. Therefore we began to search for this branch.
Unfortunately, my knowledge of the city plan doesn`t cover objects related to Stable-Tec Corporation. Therefore, we are forced to search blindly. And so far, to no avail</r>
      <r p='sh'>I`m counting on that if you find the Canterlot branch of Stable-Tec during your journey, you will tell us about its location. Such a gesture from you would be a great step to promote our cooperation</r>
      <r p='lp4'>Certainly</r>

      <r p='lp2'>How do you know my name?</r>
      <r p='mch'>For those who travel by the dark path, much that is hidden becomes revealed even before it names itself, @lp. The blind pony should not be surprised that the seeing one sees his reflection in the mirror.
But forgive my manners. Too many stars I spent surrounded by these brainless corpses. It is easy to forget how to talk with the living</r>
      <r p='mch'>My name is Mchavi. I am an old shaman of the family that derives its origin from the oldest sorcerers of zebras. And I am here on the instructions of my lord, the legate Caesarius</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Who?</r>
      <r p='mch'>Your friends from Covertsign could tell you more. Legate Caesarius is the tyrant of the Legion, the leader of the Zebra race. His destiny is to rule everything that is left of our world. My destiny is to become a pebble on the road by which he will come to his fate</r>
      <r p='lp5'>So you`re one of those damned thugs, then? And how is it like - to kill peaceful ponies?</r>
      <r p='mch'>Be careful with the words, child. Your ignorance will not bring you anything but grief. The Legion never did anything for which it had no reason to do so</r>
      <r p='lp1'>And what was the reason to ambush those who didn`t do anything to you?</r>
      <r p='mch'>Not every piece of knowledge can be obtained without preparation. Your mind is not ready to accept the truth of the Legion</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Is your truth that you need to kill everypony just for the fact of being ponies?</r>
      <r p='mch'>This is what Askari told you at your first meeting, is it not? His understanding is little better than yours.
You should only know that Caesarius has plans for everycreature, and everycreature has a purpose. And the rules of our cruel world dictate that for some the ultimate goal is to die</r>
      <r p='lp5'>I`m sick of this epic nonsense</r>
      <r p='mch'>It is sad to hear this. However, I knew that you would say this, even before your lips opened to utter the first word</r>
      <r p='mch'>The ancestors` spirits whisper to me the truth and show the way, revealing the future. They predicted that you would come here to help me. You see, my lord expects results of studying the ancient spells that our ancestors imposed on this city. They will serve the greatness of the Legion, when hundreds of our ancient dead enemies will throw themselves upon the enemies that are still living. And your heart - the heart of a healthy pony - is the last ingredient that I need for a finishing touch</r>
      <r p='mch'>This is your role in the legate`s plans. Your purpose in life, your destiny. Any worthy son of the Legion would be happy to fulfill his destiny, you... yes, I already see how you will act</r>

      <r p='lp1'>SteelHooves?</r>

      <r p='lp5'>Don`t you want to tell me something?</r>
      <r p='sh'>This voice... it is Elder Coldsight. Where did you get this record and who is the Elder talking to?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Nuh-uh, it`s my turn to ask questions.
Your Elder is making big plans to team up with the Zebra Legion. Don`t you think you should have told me that from the very beginning, if you want me to have any kind of "cooperation" with you</r>
      <r p='sh'>I know no more than you do, @lp. Look, I already told you that at the moment we have a secret confrontation with Coldsight. I have no idea about his plans, because he considers me his rival</r>
      <r p='lp5'>Don`t you though?</r>
      <r p='sh'>You were one against four of us there, in Canterlot. Now you are alone against the whole camp of the Steel Rangers. If I was on Coldsight`s side, would we leave you alive after we recognized you as a killer of Rose and Diamond? Would we leave you alive now, when you have so unreasonably declared your awareness of the Elder`s plans?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Alright, I am convinced</r>
      <r p='sh'>Now you tell me where you got this recording from. If it is not a forgery, Elder Coldsight is involved in a serious crime against the brotherhood</r>
      <r p='lp1'>In the Ministry of Image I met a Legion`s shaman who was studying the Pink Cloud. She also often contacted your Elder through a Ministry communication center. From it I extracted this entry</r>
      <r p='sh'>Then my fears are confirmed. Elder Coldsight is a respected leader of our department, but his loyalty to the Steel Rangers` ideals is questionable. Even his somewhat peculiar understanding of duty should go against plotting with zebras. Especially - with the Legion.
Such an act must have a serious cause. Even with all our differences, I still do not believe that the Elder could do this without a good reason. I`ll arrange a search for him at once</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Search?</r>
      <r p='sh'>Yes. Me and my group deliberately distanced ourselves from the rest of the Neighara department that is faithful to Coldsight. Therefore, our knowledge of the current deployment of key command figures, including the Elder himself, is limited and, perhaps, mostly obsolete. However, among his knights and paladins there are several of my secret supporters. I will contact them and find out everything we need</r>
      <r p='lp1'>How long will it take?</r>
      <r p='sh'>No more than one day. My subordinates will have to restore communications, and if we are lucky, we will be able to maintain a stable radio connection long enough. After determining the location of Coldsight, I`ll move out to face him</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I am going with you</r>
      <r p='sh'>And what is it to you? This is an internal affair of Neighara Steel Rangers. Until recently, you didn`t even know anything about us</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Now we have common interests</r>
      <r p='sh'>Ah, I see now. Stable Pi is your home, isn`t it? This explains PipBuck on your leg and your excessive neatness compared to ponies on the surface</r>
      <r p='lp2'>I don`t...</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Alright. So, you take me with you or not?</r>
      <r p='sh'>If you are from Stable Pi, this may make sense. According to that recording of yours, Elder Coldsight seeks to gain control over your Stable, and I`m sure he doesn`t want it just out of greed. Perhaps you can negotiate with him on behalf of your Stable and find a compromise that excludes bloodshed and union with zebras. We still have a chance to solve the problem peacefully</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Thank you for your trust, SteelHooves.
But since you found out my secret, I also want to ask you something. What are your disagreements with Coldsight?</r>
      <r p='sh'>Coldsight is one of those ponies whose souls have been wiped clean of all traces of emotion by life in the Wasteland. For him there is no compassion, his main goal is the prosperity of the Steel Rangers and no one else. This directly violates the original principles of the Steel Rangers, who were created by Applejack to protect all ponies. But his position is now shared by many influential commanders of our fraction, and they are extremely obstinate in promoting their policies. To oppose them means to start a civil war among Rangers. I want this even less than leaving Coldsight in power. Therefore, my supporters and I try to avoid conflicts</r>
      <r p='sh'>But, unfortunately, Coldsight is too suspicious and understands that I am able to influence his subordinates. Therefore, he looks at me only as a direct competitor in a struggle for power. Until now, we have been able to smooth sharp edges out in our relationship. Sincerely I hope that this will continue being so in the future, even despite the upcoming difficult conversation</r>
      <r p='sh'>Well, enough chitchat. If you`re going to join me in the negotiations, you should pick up the better equipment. Armor most of all. Even though I hope for a peaceful outcome, we must prepare for the worst</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Alright, I`ll take care of it</r>

      <r p="sh">Yes. From a reliable source we learned that he is in command of an old military base not very far from here</r>
      <r p="lp2">Then we move out?</r>
      <r p="sh">Couldn`t say you are prepared well enough for a possible encounter. However we can not waste time - if Coldsight decides to move to another base of the Neighara division, it may be much more difficult to meet him. Mooving out at once!</r>

      <t v="0.8">Information received from SteelHooves</t>
      <r p='sh'>Hello, @lp. Looks like I underestimated you</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Why?</r>
      <r p='sh'>You killed Coldsight. My supporters among his rangers told me about this just now. You made a very dangerous move.
Until that moment, you were nopony for the Steel Rangers. After the murder of the Elder, his followers will never forget you. From now on, you should travel with even more caution</r>
      <r p='lp2'>His followers? Isn`t you conflict over after his death?</r>
      <r p='sh'>On the contrary, now it will become even more fierce. However, this was inevitable. The only chance of avoiding bloodshed was my refusal from command and voluntary exile. Maybe I should have done that. Too many have already died because of this confrontation, and many more will perish in the future</r>
      <r p='sh'>I think you need to know something. Since you have proven yourself a consistent and implacable enemy of Coldsight`s ideas, I believe that I can trust you more than ever. And I think it is time to provide you with information that can help you</r>
      <r p='sh'>First: the treacherous collusion of Coldsight and the Legion appears to have very deep roots. Apparently, almost all the commanders of his divisions and even common knights are aware of this union and are ready to accept it. This means that the interaction of these two forces will continue and, probably, zebras will also join the conflict soon. We still don`t know the reasons for this unification, but my subordinates are working to obtain the necessary information</r>
      <r p='sh'>Second: Coldsight had schematics of some experimental combat exoskeleton, which, apparently, is being developed in your Stable. Apparently, this exoskeleton was the main reason for Coldsight`s interest in the Stable Pi. It is an armor and a weapon at the same time, with deadly combat power</r>
      <r p='sh'>However, only one such unit can exist: it requires unique pre-war artifacts that don`t have any analogues that I know of. In truth, I never heard about them until I received the documentation for this exoskeleton. Projects for its creation have the names "Sun" and "Rainbow". I correctly understand that you were sent to the surface to collect the necessary artifacts?</r>
      <r p='lp5'>...</r>
      <r p='sh'>I`m not going to take them away from you or attack your Stable, you have a word of a paladin. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. You helped me, I`ll help you. If your Stable is threatened by an invasion of Neighara Steel Rangers or the zebras` Legion, we will stand for its defense</r>
      <r p='lp4'>I`m glad to hear it, thank you. But I hope that my Stable will avoid danger</r>
      <r p='sh'>I wouldn`t rely just on hope. Our enemies are strong, and we have much to do if we want to protect ourselves from them. Right now, groups of my loyal knights are engaged in battle in several places at once, defending important fortifications and trying to free those brethren who were captured at the first enemy attack. Perhaps in the near future this war will draw in new participants, either at their will or against it</r>
      <r p='lp1'>This means that the danger threatens many ponies, and not just us and my Stable! I was too selfish. I must warn residents of two settlements at once about the coming threat. They must not be caught off guard by the attack of the Steel Rangers and the Legion</r>
      <r p='sh'>I understand your haste. As soon as you warn everypony you need, I`m waiting for you here: we may need your help</r>

      <r p='sh'>Yes. The pre-war storage bunker south east of us. One of several main warehouses of our division. However, it is well protected, I would advise against trying to get inside</r>
      <r p='lp1'>We`ll see about that</r>
      <r p='sh'>Not this time, @lp. This bunker was designed specifically to protect its contents from an attack of a small army. In a locked state its doors can`t be destroyed even by the explosion of a tactical balefire bomb. To capture it, it would take a several month-long siege and to starve its defenders</r>
      <r p='lp3'>To capture it - maybe. But what about infiltration?</r>

Recently I`ve been involved in matters that I would rather not touch. And I learned a lot of disturbing things that I have to share with you</r>
      <r p="ze1">Did something happen in Canterlot?</r>
      <r p="lp1">Not only there. We are talking about much more than just old ruins.
It became known to me that the Steel Rangers' Neighara division formed a military alliance with the Legion and Caesar. The reasons are unknown, but the consequence was an armed conflict among Steel Rangers. At the moment it is expanding dramatically. Considering that many of their targets are located in relative proximity to Covertsign, I am afraid that you might be in danger. If not from the Steel Rangers, then from the Legion soldiers</r>

      <r p="va">Ok, to defend ourselves against such a strong enemy as Steel Rangers...
We definitely need big guns</r>
      <r p="lp1">I have some reliable sources...</r>
      <r p="va">No, @lp. BIG Guns.
If we arm ourselves with just anti-mech rifles, we might be able to manage an even fight against power armor. But believe me: Coldsight`s Steel Rangers are not ones afraid of fighting on equal terms. They won`t stop if they decide to crush us, and even if we win, we would pay too much for such victory</r>
      <r p="va">If we cannot make Steel Rangers fear us, then at least we must delay the assault on the camp. And this can only be achieved if the cost of attacking the "Prancing Pony" is sky-high</r>
      <r p="lp3">To be honest, I am not sure how this can be done</r>
      <r p="va">Luckily I am sure enough. Listen.
When I was with the Rangers, we had access to the archive containing a detailed map of our Factory. From there we learned about the assembly lines for manufacturing naval guns and ammunition placed on one of the underground floors. Guns for destroyers, to be precise. Small caliber guns for ships, big enough for us</r>
      <r p="va">We, Steel Rangers, should have dealt with them long ago, but there was little use for them in the Wasteland, and we always had more important stuff to do. Now it work play into our hooves, hooves of the "Prancing Pony"</r>
      <r p="lp1">And I must explore those production lines?</r>
      <r p="va">If you are willing to help, yes. I will show you the exact location of the desired rooms, and you will go down and find out if there are at least a couple of these weapon systems left in the warehouses. And make sure that when our scavenging teams come, they won`t be met with fire from security turrets. I know you are good at it</r>

      <r p="lp4">It`s all good, Oak. Warehouses are still full, there are lots of shells, and neither robots nor turrets will harm anypony scavenging there anymore</r>
      <r p="va">Very well. In truth, even a single weapon of this kind would be enough to make Coldsight`s troopers think twice before attacking us, but it never hurts to have extra.
We can`t put them on wheels and use them as offensive weapons, but a static defense will be more than enough. Now we have a lot of work to do, and I hope that we are not too late</r>
      <r p="lp1">I hope that if something goes wrong, me and SteelHooves` rangers will be close enough to come to the rescue</r>
      <r p="va">SteelHooves? If it`s him opposing Coldsight you shouldn`t worry. That old fox has ears everywhere. Coldsight really shouldn`t have crossed him: with all respect, he simply won`t be able to defeat a commander with almost two hundred years of experience</r>
      <r p="lp2">With how many years of experience?!</r>
      <r p="va">You didn’t know? SteelHooves is a Canterlot ghoul. He fought in the Great War. You should`ve told me earlier that he is our ally. He has great authority among the rangers. And he, unlike Coldsight, treats the Wasteland ponies with enough kindness. If the "Prancing Pony" is indeed at war, we should do our best to gain his support</r>
      <r p="lp1">I didn`t expect this, really. But you`re right: if Coldsight`s soldiers attack peaceful settlements, he will intervene.
To tell the truth, at least one more settlement definitely needs help. So unless I`m still needed here, I`d better hurry there</r>
      <r p="va">You don`t have time to waste, do you? Of course, run along. We will manage here ourselves.
If you meet SteelHooves, say hello from me. And thanks for telling us about him. Perhaps it`s the best news we had lately</r>

An open armed conflict is flaring up right now, and it is unlikely to end until the complete destruction of one of the sides.

      <r p="lp1">As far as I can tell, rangers are used to a positional war. They will fight for important bases and warehouses, as well as for the territory around them. One of the bases is located relatively close to here</r>
      <r p="zeb1">And that means the risk of an accidental encounter with our troops or even the settlement itself. While we could solve the rangers problem peacefully, the Legion will deploy forces for our anihilation withought a second thought</r>
      <r p="zeb3">This war is unlikely to last long. If we gather enough supplies and go north for a few months, we can wait out this storm and then come back</r>
      <r p="zeb2">Wait, it`s too early to judge. @lp, how do you know all this?</r>
      <r p="lp1">I was getting there.
First, I know the leader of one of the sides of this conflict. The one that is against friendship with the Legion. Second... in Canterlot, I happened to meet a Legion sorceress. Her name was Mchavi</r>
      <r p="ze1">This is bad...</r>
      <r p="zeb4">If the Legion sent necromancers to this region we already are at risk. Many of them have the gift of sight. Our discovery is now a matter of time</r>
      <r p="zeb1">...And even if we go north now, we cannot go back if the Legion wins. If necromancers are here, this means that Caesar is planning to settle in these parts for good.
We must attack. Now, before they find us. We have fighters, surprise is on our side. I`m tired of hiding! Strike the enemy, take advantage of the moment and let rangers finish them! Enough running away!</r>
      <r p="zeb4">... stupid</r>
      <r p="ze1">This is suicide, Mwimbaji. Surprise attack will work only once. As soon as the Legion finds out about us, we are doomed. We will be hunted down and slaughtered, sooner or later. We do not even know the exact balance of power in this conflict. So far, Mshauri’s proposal sounds the most logical</r>
      <r p="lp3">What if I help you? Even if the Legion finds out who attacked them, I`m just a pony, my actions will not give out your presence</r>
      <r p="zeb2">It will be difficult to do it single-hoofedly. You need to know exactly where to hit. And even in this case, chances are not particularly high</r>
      <r p="zeb3">Still it really would protect ourselves. And even if this pony fails, the Legion is unlikely to take her alive, it is not their style.
But we cannot rely on success. In any case, we must begin preparations for leaving</r>
      <r p="lp2">"Not their style"?</r>
      <r p="ze1">For all its faults, the Legion does not permit torture of those brave enough to confront it. This is a very ancient tradition, a sort of paying respects: a brave enemy should die on the battlefield, not in chains. Even a pony. A noble tradition... and so irrational</r>
      <r p="zeb2">There only small thing that remains - to die bravely</r>
      <r p="lp1">...
	I would rather not die at all</r>
      <r p="zeb4">However, we cannot tell you where you can find agents of the Legion. And we won`t look for them either. The risk is too high.
Preparations for moving north will take a lot of time. If you somehow succeed and buy us some time, we would appreciate it. But we cannot wait</r>
      <r p="lp4">I think I know who can help me</r>
      <r p="ze1">Then so be it. @lp, we are all very grateful to you for your determination and your helping hoof. We will understand if you change your mind, and remember, it is better to save your life than reach your goal and die, because your death would be a greater loss</r>

      <r p="lp1">Hello SteelHooves. I have a proposition which will likely suit both of us</r>
      <r p="sh">I am listening, @lp</r>
      <r p="lp1">Do your scouts know anything about the the Legion movements?</r>
      <r p="sh">Just as much as Coldsight`s followers know. My informants tell me a lot, but sending patrols for monitoring zebras is too irrational.
At the moment, the Legion has focused its efforts on helping my former brethren. It is strong enough for an open battle, but prefers to hinder the actions of my forces with ambush and sabotage</r>
      <r p="lp3">Are there any vulnerabilities in their strategy?</r>
      <r p="sh">Hard to tell. Perhaps destruction of their field headquarters in this region could cause confusion in their operations and force them to temporarily curtail their activities. However, zebras are closely watching every step of my troops, and sending an assault team might fail. They would just relocate</r>
      <r p="sh">You aren`t just asking out of pure interest, right? If you are intending to visit zebra command, I can tell you their current location. Destroying the field Legion leadership will provide operating space for our offensive, and your skills in independent operations give serious chances for success. Clever</r>
      <r p="lp1">Thank you! Sure, I will pay the Legion commanders a visit soon. By the way, one pony sends his regards. Oak Stalwort</r>

      <r p="ze1" push="1">...</r>

      <r p="ze1">This is very good news for us, @lp. I know how Legion works. Distruction of command is a big problem for them, and they will not recover anytime soon. And if the Legion zebras discovered us one way or another, it would have been written here.
We can be sure that we are safe for now. At least we can devote more time to collecting and preparing supplies. And maybe we don`t have to leave at all. Your help is invaluable to us!</r>

      <r p="wat">Hello @lp. Good thing you showed up just in time</r>
      <r p="lp2">Uh... hi? I don`t think we know each other, perhaps you`d better introduce yourself</r>
      <r p="wat">Yes, of course, forgive me my rudeness. My real name won`t tell you anything, so just call me Watcher.
If you remember, after your success at Stable 88 Mentor asked you to bring the cogitator to Hankey garages. I was the one you were supposed to meet. Unfortunately, we were interrupted</r>
      <r p="lp1">How did you find me?</r>
      <r p="wat">Both of you. Fortunately, I found both you and the Chosen-24. That wasn`t easy. Velvet and I have already discussed a lot, now we need to talk with you</r>
      <r p="lp1">Wait a minute. Velvet, can he be trusted?</r>
      <r p="vel">Yes, I suppose so. He told me enough to make me believe him</r>
      <r p="lp1">Good. I not only found the cogitator, but also the Alicorn Amulet! And the Black Book too. Did Mentor tell you that they are also important for the projects? I suppose they should be transferred as soon as possible, because...</r>
      <r p="wat">...Neighara Rangers teamed with the Legion and are planning an attack on Stable Pi. We are aware of that, @lp.
No, the artifacts must stay with you. I`m afraid you will need them more. I will explain why. But first let me tell you about yourself</r>
      <r p="wat">Mentor has already told you that you were sent on a mission to collect the missing components required to complete the "Sun" and "Rainbow" projects. As well as that you voluntarily agreed to temporarily block your memory in order to ensure safety of your home. This technology has a significant drawback: images in your memory are blocked as whole objects, but not each individual part of them. This means that if you restore a part of your memories, you will remember everything that is directly related to the restored part. Listen: Mentor has a silver-gray mane...</r>
      <r p="lp2">...and light purple coat. He has a hockey stick cutie mark, he wears glasses and really loves his job! And also apple jam.
Oh Goddess, I really remembered him!</r>
      <r p="wat">See? However, now it`s much more important for you to remember the details of the projects on which he is working</r>
      <r p="vel">He`s right, @lp. Now we have the responsibility of protecting our home. And no matter how hard it is for me to admit it, the weapons that Mentor is trying to complete may be our fail-safe in case something goes wrong</r>
      <r p="vel">The "Sun" and "Rainbow" projects are interconnected. "Rainbow" is a powerful exoskeleton equipped with almost impenetrable armor and wings that can lift an earth pony or a unicorn into the air. And the "Sun" is an extremely complex Rainbow-based system, the purpose of which is to artificialy enhance survivability and magical abilities of the owner. Together they are able to give power second only to the legendary might of Celestia and Luna. But only by destruction capabilities</r>
      <r p="lp3">Yes, I remember that. Those systems are incredibly complex to operate, a real miracle of technology. Mentor, like his predecessors, believed that only they were able to ensure the complete safety of Stable Pi when the time comes to become open for the surface. And they... we all wanted to finally end our isolation. But they were afraid to do it without protection</r>
      <r p="vel">While we were sitting in our high-tech shell, surface ponies suffered and died, generation after generation, waiting until we assemble a gun large enough to shoot them all if something goes wrong. So that it`s not too scary to say hi</r>
      <r p="lp5">Velvet, the surface is full of ponies which only respect size of your guns in a conversation. And it will only make surface life better and safer</r>
      <r p="vel">...</r>
      <r p="wat">For good or for worse, but things have developed like this. For two hundred years, Stable Pi was isolated from the Wasteland, and ponies living in it saved much of the technological past of Equestria. @lp, have you ever wondered why you can access full functionality of M.A.S. terminals?</r>
      <r p="lp3">Because they recognize my PipBuck signature?</r>
      <r p="wat">Exactly. Only PipBucks of Stable inhabitants still possess the software necessary for recognition by terminals, as well as many other M.A.S. equipment. Memory in those used by rare lucky surface ponies has been erased many times already. But this is nothing in comparison with the many projects on which your Stable worked before the Last Day came. This includes the "Sun" and "Rainbow" projects</r>
      <r p="wat">It was those which attracted Coldsight. But for now, there is still an opportunity to solve everything... more or less peacefully</r>
      <r p="lp1">Our Stable is at risk of an open invasion. How can we solve this "peacefully"?</r>
      <r p="vel">There is a way. But there is no guarantee</r>
      <r p="wat">I don`t call myself Watcher for nothing, @lp. Using a network of sprite bots I learn a lot about what is happening in the Wasteland. And the Mentor learns this from me</r>
      <r p="wat">I know why Coldsight decided to attack Stable Pi, and why his alliance with Caesarea became possible. A threat appeared in the Wasteland, capable of forcing even irreconcilable enemies to unite against them. The Enclave.
When the Last Day came, Equestria pegasi abandonded their dying country and blocked the sky. Since then there has not been a single sunny day in the Wasteland. Pegasi themselves have been living above the cloud barrier for two hundred years. I don`t know what`s going on there, but recently at least some of them came to a conclusion that voluntary isolation should end. A large detachment of pegasi, calling themselves the Great Pegasus Enclave, descended to the surface about four months ago and established a military base, not letting anypony approach it</r>
      <r p="lp1">I am familiar with one pegasus. His name is Calamity. Do you know him? He has nothing to do with this, right?</r>
      <r p="wat">He has a complicated story. But no, he has nothing to do with it</r>
      <r p="wat">Coldsight`s Steel Rangers attempted to get in touch with the Enclave but received no response. The memory of the old betrayal of pegasi and suspicion of the old elder made him perceive the new power as a threat to Steel Rangers in general and to himself in particular. Despite lacking evidence for hostile intentions of the Enclave towards surface ponies, he began preparing for war. Like a paranoid spider, he weaved his web inside the Neighara branch, separating those he trusted from the rest, and dedicating them to his plans to attack the Enclave base</r>
      <r p="wat">But he was intelligent enough for making a sober estimate of his forces and possible forces of the enemy. He understood that the base could be just a tip of an iceberg: after all, he didn`t know anything about how pegasi have been surviving for the last two hundred years and what proportion of the pre-war military power they managed to preserve. And he found himself an ally in the form of Caesar, who also saw a great threat in the appearance of a new force in the Wasteland</r>
      <r p="vel">And so he planned an attack on Stable Pi, @lp. He knew about the projects, and he planned using them to win the impending war. And if there is no war...</r>
      <r p="lp1">...there would be no threat to our home. Is Mentor aware of all this?</r>
      <r p="wat">Yes. And he asked me to give you a new task: to find out why the Enclave came down to the surface and how to make it leave</r>
      <r p="vel">Right now the Rangers and the Legion are fighting a fierce battle with each other. It will also lose meaning if the Enclave disappears. Given Coldsite`s death, opponents may even sit at the negotiating table. So this will not only be a blessing for Stable Pi</r>
      <r p="lp2">But... is it possible? How can we achieve it?</r>
      <r p="wat">I don`t know. The Enclave also refused to contact me. They shot every Sprite bot I sent. Before you act, you have to learn more about them and their goals. As Velvet said, there is no guarantee this will work. But for now this is the best option of all we have</r>
      <r p="vel">And if it doesn`t work, we will have to prepare for defending Stable Pi</r>
      <r p="lp1">I can infiltrate the base and find out what pegasi are looking for</r>
      <r p="vel">Perhaps we have no other options. But please, @lp, by all means try to find a peaceful solution. We don`t need even more blood</r>
      <r p="wat">And if a peaceful contact fails, you become the first line of defense for Stable Pi. Therefore, the artifacts remain with you. You must survive and succeed, and they will increase your chances</r>

      <r p="lp5">Electric fence... I recall that we had something similar in our Stable. This is bad... very bad! This means that every metal object in this room becomes deadly. I can`t step on metal floor, touch metal walls, doors and furniture, otherwise electric discharges will seriously damage my health. And I can`t even touch them with telekinesis - the telekinetic field will serve as a conductor and I will get a full blast of it or even worse</r>
      <r p="lp1">Only concrete, wood and plastic are relatively safe. Those materials do not conduct current; I can step on them or move them by telekinesis</r>
      <r p="lp4">But there might be good news! If this system is similar to ours, there should be control terminals somewhere from which the fence can be disabled. I`m sure that I can hack them. With all my experience how can I possibly fail?</r>

      <r p="lp3">So, let`s see what we have here. Specification... naval gun, model 8210 "Raven". Designed to destroy torpedo boats and other small ships.

      <r p="lp4">Cool! If we install at least a couple of such guns near the camp, not a single Steel Ranger will dare to approach it. What the heck, let them come with a tank! Now "Prancing Pony" will for sure become the most fortified settlement in the area</r>

      <r p="term">Please note: electrical protection is designed to protect important strategic objects. The primary task is to prevent infiltration by enemy agents and theft of important documentation containing military secrets. A secondary task is personnel protection. Based on this, each employee is required to know the rules of conduct during activation of the electrical fence:</r>
      <r p="term">Upon hearing the alarm, immediately get off the metal floor; do not touch metal walls, stairs, doors, furniture and equipment. Move upon the concrete floor, and where there is none, climb onto wooden or plastic desks, sofas or boxes. Stay there until the fence is powered down</r>
      <r p="term">All pegasi are forbidden to fly into the air, all unicorns - to touch metal objects with telekinesis and teleport. Such actions  can be deadly while the electrical fence is activated. Also remember that rubber shoes or protective suits will not save you from electric shock, although they will weaken its effect</r>
      <r p="term">For the duration of the electrical fence, the robotic security enters alert state. Do not make sudden movements in presence of security robots and keep your ID cards in sight. Remember that your life and safety depend on knowledge and strict compliance with these rules</r>

      <r p="wat">We cannot blame her for what she did, Velvet! Everything indicated the impossibility of negotiations. After all the horrors of the Wasteland, in her situation...</r>
      <r p="vel">The only thing that was required "in her situation" was caution! Don`t you understand the consequences? Doesn`t death of so many ponies concern you?</r>
      <r p="wat">I have seen enough acts way worse and can provide a sober estimate of the situation, young lady! Her decisions were justified! It is our fault we didn`t predict the consequences. This is not the time for tearing your mane out. It`s time to act!</r>
      <r p="lp1">Please... I understand what I did. I made a mistake and went too far. But then... I just couldn`t do otherwise.
Watcher is right. We need to act</r>
      <r p="vel">We must notify everypony about what happened. Everypony we can. War is coming, and we have little time.
There, at this base you killed much more ponies than a dozen of Enclave soldiers, @lp. Much more</r>
      <r p="wat">Velvet! You shouldn`t make such accusations.
I am already working on notifying surface settlements. And you, @lp, have to warn Mentor. And give him the artifacts. Perhaps he will be able to complete the "Sun" and "Rainbow"  projects. Perhaps he will even agree to help us</r>
      <r p="vel">Sorry @lp, but I will stay to help the Watcher. No matter how I want returning home with you, my skills will be more important here</r>
      <r p="lp1">Good. Then I move out immediately.
...
Forgive me, Velvet. I... I tried to be nice</r>
      <r p="vel">No need apologizing to me. You will be your own judge. And no pony could be as strict on yourself as you can</r>

  <txt id="dialVelvet5" v="0.8">
    <n>
      <r p="vel">And yet, @lp, even though you massacred everypony there at the base, you spared the commander who surrendered</r>
      <r p="lp1">Yes, I spared him</r>
      <r p="vel">Just one step forward after everything that happened. But this step saved a life of a pony. Perhaps not just one</r>
      <r p="vel">You may have made a mistake, @lp, but this action says a lot about you</r>

      <t>Way home</t>
      <r p="lp1">How can I return to Stable Pi?</r>
      <r p="wat">This is much easier than you might think. The teleportation system built into the MAS Emergency Rescue System terminal will bring you home</r>
      <r p="lp2">A terminal? So simple!</r>
      <r p="lp3" push="1">Err... Or not?</r>
      <r p="lp3">I can only teleport to where I was before. I have no idea where my home is</r>
      <r p="wat">You don`t need its coordinates to return home. All you need is a PipBuck belonging to its true owner and containing access codes for Stable Pi</r>
      <r p="lp2">And I have those codes?</r>
      <r p="wat">No. But I have. Right now they are being transferred to your PipBuck. Just a little longer... there. Now you can use PipBuck map to go home. Perhaps we meet again, @lp</r>
      <r p="lp2">Wait! You never told me who you really are. If you aren`t a resident of Stable Pi, then what is your relation to it? What is your relationship with Mentor, where did you get the access codes and all the information that you told me? I have a right to know, don`t you think?</r>
      <r p="vel">Yes, we really should know. Trust must be mutual, right? You know so much about us, but I can`t say we know anything about you</r>
      <r>*** The Sprite bot makes a strange sound. As if somepony at the other end of the line took a deep breath ***</r>
      <r p="wat">Very well.. You are right, I will tell you about myself. A little</r>
      <r p="wat" push="1">The most extraordinary thing you should know about me is that I am a dragon</r>
      <r p="vel">A dragon?!</r>
      <r p="lp2">A dragon? But... I only saw dragons in books! You still exist?</r>
      <r p="wat">I have not seen any of my kind for a very long time. Perhaps I am the last dragon in this area. But more important is that, being a dragon, I can live for a very long time. I still remember what Equestria was before the war with zebras</r>
      <r p="vel">And... are you really more than two hundred years old?</r>
      <r p="wat">I was a personal assistant of Twilight Sparkle, head of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. And while the Stables were mostly outside our jurisdiction, Stable Pi was very closely connected to us. As soon as I found a way to contact you after the Last Day, I helped you as much as I could. Including with the search for artifacts</r>
      <r p="vel">That is, you help us because you actually were there at our origins?</r>
      <r p="wat">Yes and no. My and Stable Pi`s paths rarely crossed until the end of the War. But when the world was destroyed, I began grasping at every fragment possible to save. Most of the time I was unable to do anything. However, while your Stable lives, this world has one more piece of Equestria I remember. I want to help protecting it</r>
      <r p="lp2">But still... A dragon...</r>
      <r p="wat">However, all this doesn`t matter now. I am too far away to help you otherwise than with sprite bots, and I... cannot abandon my place. What matters now is that we must act. @lp, now you can teleport home through the terminal any time. I helped you with what I could, and now I have to fly. But let`s keep in touch</r>

      <r p="lp1">Thank you... I`m also glad to be back home. Yet we have a lot to discuss</r>
      <r p="men">Of course @lp. We do it right away</r>
    </n>
  </txt>
  <txt id="dialMen2" v="0.8">
    <n>
      <r p="men">The Watcher tells me a lot about what is happening, but, Holy Celestia, he never brought me such news! So you are saying that pegasi are about to descend from the clouds and start a war on the surface?</r>
      <r p="lp1">Yes, exactly. My attack on the base will most likely provoke the Enclave into a retaliation campaign. Soon the surface will turn into a battlefield. Or a slaughterhouse</r>
      <r p="men">Oh, what times we have to live in! But don`t worry, dear. Now you are here, home and safe. Here you will rest, take a rehabilitation course, and your life will return to its former, peaceful course. At your request we can erase memories of all nightmares of the surface</r>
      <r p="lp2">Excuse me?</r>
      <r p="men">Aren`t you glad to be here again? Just imagine: now that you have acquired the artifacts, we are going to complete such an amazing project! We all struggled for so many years - so many centuries to find a solution! Were we ever this close to completing the project?
I understand, @lp, you had a lot to go through. But we will help you. Mrs. Heartrose will provide you with professional psychological assistance, your colleagues and relatives will help you to get back on your feet. You will be honored, @lp. Honored as a hero, the first Chosen able to achieve the goal</r>
      <r p="lp2">And... you will let surface ponies die?</r>
      <r p="men">As far as I know, "dying" is quite a normal condition for them. For two hundred years they have been exterminating each other in every way they could. I don`t understand your question</r>
      <r p="lp5">How can you even say that? How can you now, at such a minute, just lock yourself up and go about your business as if nothing happened?</r>
      <r p="men">Hush, hush! Don`t be angry. As I understand, you managed to become attached to the surface inhabitants. Perhaps there even is some sence in your desire to help them. But if we consider the whole situation, it is simply unreasonable</r>
      <r p="lp1">Alright. I`ll try to be patient now. But you have to listen to me</r>
      <r p="lp1">I know that our Stable has been sealed for almost two centuries. I know that our main goal has always been the "Sun" project, and that we denied contacts until we secure ourselves. But right now there are settlements and organizations on the surface which we could make a lasting peace with. They can help us establish a connection with the surface, and we would help them live and prosper. And right now they are in mortal danger. We can try to complete the exoskeleton and protect them. Otherwise, we may simply end up with nowhere to go and no pony to contact</r>
      <r p="men">Now I hear my student talking! You always knew how to express your thoughts, and I always appreciated it in you. But you are missing one important aspect. We are not all-powerful, @lp. We don`t know how strong this so-called Enclave is, and we don`t know how far they can go in their war. Yes, we might lose potential friends if we refrain from helping them. But if we interfere, we will be at risk of facing mortal danger with them. And we can`t even tell how high this risk might be</r>
      <r p="men">We cannot afford risking our Stable so recklessly. The very thought of loosing Stable Pi and all the knowledge we possess... If we stay here and complete the project, we have much better chances for survival. This should be decisive</r>
      <r p="lp1">I... I see your reason. You`re right. You shouldn`t risk lives of ponies living here for a war that doesn`t concern them.
In that case I will give you the artifacts needed to complete the projects and leave this place</r>
      <r p="men">What? Are you out of your mind, @lp?</r>
      <r p="lp1">Maybe you can sit here in your little sanctuary, enjoying peace and quiet, but there is a war about to begin up there because of me! And I can`t stay here knowing what`s going on!</r>
      <r p="men">I won`t let you, @lp! For your good, I forbid you to leave Stable Pi! The necessary psychological assistance will be provided to you, we will give you a rehabilitation course!</r>
      <r p="lp5">You forbid me? Well, then make me obey this order</r>
      <r p="men">...</r>
      <r p="men" push="1">You are making a big mistake, @lp. The Wasteland has already injured you enough. Your consciousness is experiencing the Hoofington syndrome. I am warning you. Don`t leave</r>
      <r p="lp1">Still I have to say no. Take the artifacts. I hope you can complete the project</r>
      <r p="men">Well... I wasn`t exclude this possibility. May Celestia have mercy on you...</r>

      <r p="men">I thought so. I made a mistake letting her go, even though she volunteered. Now it`s obvious that her goal was just to escape from us... although I still don`t understand why</r>

      <r p="lp4">Hi, Transistor. And you have not changed a bit. Still messing around with your chips?</r>
      <r p="sc1">Of course, this is my specialty, but what else could I do? Can`t wait until I can start working with a quantum cogitator. This is a real miracle, a triumph of technology. When Mentor informed us that you managed to acquire it, I almost went crazy! Frankly, I did not believe in your success at all, according to my calculations, its probability was 3720 to...</r>
      <r p="lp4">Enough talking about chances already</r>
      <r p="sc1">Heeey!</r>
      <r p="lp1">Better explain what role the cogitator plays in the "Sun" project?</r>
      <r p="sc1">What do you mean, what role? It will help to turn the user of the "Rainbow" exoskeleton into a super-soldier. It will evaluate a situation on a battlefield right up to probable trajectories of each bullet and vulnerabilities of each enemy. It will calculate how to move, how to aim, how to control each movement on the ground and in the air and will predict the movements of each enemy. It`s like S.A.T.S., only a thousand times cooler with everything working in real time! We already have all the algorithms, we only need a very powerful processor</r>
      <r p="lp2">I shudder to think what it`s like fighting such an enemy!</r>
      <r p="sc1">Well... There is only a single copy of a quantum cogitator, nothing like this exists anywhere. It`s like a whole maneframe in your pocket! And now we have it, so you shouldn`t worry that it could be used by enemies</r>
      <r p="lp3">Is it really that unique? And to think that I used it as an expansion module for my PipBuck</r>
      <r p="sc1">...</r>
      <r p="sc1" push="1">...</r>
      <r p="sc1" push="1">... @lp, you didn’t use it as a hammer as well by any chance, did you?</r>
      <r p="lp1">Well, perhaps just once... You know, up there I had many various adventures</r>
      <r p="sc1">... Don`t do this again, okay? Let me give you my extension module instead. It does the same thing, with the only difference that it is not a piece of unique and incredibly valuable technology</r>
      <r p="lp1">Alright, relax. You know, sitting in a workshop all the time makes you kind of nervous. I was glad to see you, don`t work yourself to death</r>

  <txt id="dialSc2" v="0.8">
    <n>
      <r p="sc2">@lp, so this is whom we owe for the "Rainbow" armor schematics! You can`t imagine how long I waited for an opportunity to look into them</r>
      <r p="lp4">Lime Fizzy, how is the foundry doing?</r>
      <r p="sc2">The work is in full swing, the "Rainbow" armor is almost ready. If we do everything right, this will be a true masterpiece</r>
      <r p="lp2">Is this armor really so special? I have seen a lot on the surface, it will be hard to impress me</r>
      <r p="sc2">Believe me, this armor will be special. First, it is equipped with wings and will allow its owner to fly. Second, those magical artifacts that you obtained will incredibly increase its protective properties. And third, it should significantly increase magical power and efficiency of weapons for its owner</r>
      <r p="sc2">Therefore, we are planning to call it the "Alicorn Armor". The one who puts it on will not be inferior even to the goddesses Celestia and Luna themselves</r>
      <r p="lp2">It sounds really impressive. I hope such power won`t ever be used for evil. I saw too much violence there on the surface... I myself caused a significant portion of it</r>
      <r p="sc2">It was tough, hey? How is it... up there? Really bad?</r>
      <r p="lp3">How should I put it... Yes and no. Up there life can be harsh. And very cruel. Often it`s either kill or be killed. But at the same time, that life... is real. I don`t know how to explain...</r>
      <r p="sc2">I think I understand. That is precisely why we are creating the "Alicorn Armor"</r>

      <r p="lp1">Hi, Mrs. Heartrose. Yes, I should return as soon as possible, I have a very important business left unfinished up there</r>
      <r p="sc3">Can I somehow convince you to stay?</r>
      <r p="lp1">I don`t think so. Sorry, I don`t need psychological assistance. At least not right now. Terrible things will soon start happening above, and... to some extent... it`s my fault</r>
      <r p="sc3">I see. Then I will not discourage you or annoy you with my advice, especially since I don`t feel it`s my place to give it to you. Obviously, you have experienced many things that I have no idea about, so I`m hardly able to correctly assess the situation and make a decision for you. Is it a feeling of responsibility that drives you?</r>
      <r p="lp1">Probably. And there are also my friends who will soon need my help</r>
      <r p="sc3">Then go. Otherwise you will never be able to forgive yourself for standing apart</r>
      <r p="sc3">By Celestia, the only thing we have been doing all of our lives is standing apart...</r>
      <r p="lp4">Thank you. I actually feel a little better</r>
      <r p="sc3">Good. Then let me give you a small advice. Don`t leave right now, a couple of hours will hardly make a difference. Take a walk around the Stable, see your friends, take a look into your room. After all, this is your home, and even a short stay at home will surely have a beneficial effect on you</r>
      <r p="lp1">Ok, I will follow your advice. And don`t worry about me, we`ll see each other again, and then there will be time for serious heart-to-heart talks</r>

    <n>
      <r p="lp4">Hello professor. I`m not disturbing?</r>
      <r p="sc4">What? Ah, @lp, not at all, not at all... So it means you came back after fulfilling your great mission? I believed in you!</r>
      <r p="lp1">Yes, yes, and not just came back, but with those darn artifacts. You can`t even imagine how much trouble it cost me to get them! Was it really impossible to do without them?</r>
      <r p="sc4">Oh, I wish it was... You see, these artifacts are absolutely unique, nothing can replace them</r>
      <r p="lp1">Then could you at least explain in more detail what for I had to put my health at risk?</r>
      <r p="sc4">Oh, of course. The Alicorn Amulet is an ancient and unique object in many respects. We know a lot about it from research reports of the Ministry of Arcane Sciences. It is based on a large crystal of arcanite of the finest purity - an extremely rare mineral, one even might say, a legendary one. This mineral has ability to repeatedly enhance various energies directed at it, including unicorn magic
</r>
      <r p="sc4">However, the magical disturbances arising from it can extremely negatively affect personality of the magician himself, distorting his thinking and perception. The creators of the Amulet could not eliminate this effect, so for centuries it was considered to be cursed, enslaving souls of its owners. But we have all the power of both pre-war and modern science on our side, and I know the ways how to completely protect the user of our "Alicorn Armor"</r>
      <r p="lp1">And what about the Black Book?</r>
      <r p="sc4">Ah, this artifact is something completely different, but also very remarkable. For a long time ponies considered zebras to be a sort of dumb savages, thanks to the propaganda machine during the Ministries times. This, of course, is complete nonsense. Zebras bypassed us in many areas of knowledge, their shamanism, alchemy and necromancy are in no way inferior to our magic. Otherwise, how could the Great War last so many years and end the way it ended?</r>
      <r p="lp1">Believe me, professor, over the past weeks I`ve learned a lot about zebras that sure wasn`t written in your books. I would prefer not to know any of this</r>
      <r p="sc4">Very interesting. I would greatly appreciate if you put this newly acquired knowledge on paper</r>
      <r p="lp1">Maybe later...</r>
      <r p="sc4">Err... yes. So, the Black Book. It was created many centuries ago by an insane zebra alchemist, written in blood, bound in zebra skin and enchanted with the help of evil shamanism unknown to us. That`s only what it is on the outside. In fact, we don`t know much about it. But that little that we know is amazing! For example, with its help you can make objects almost indestructible. Just imagine this feature being applied in the production of armor! The book itself also cannot be destroyed by any means known to us</r>
      <r p="lp2">But then why didn`t zebras create such armor themselves?</r>
      <r p="sc4">Good question. Apparently, the knowledge contained in the Black Book was considered forbidden and secret even among zebras themselves. In addition, these spells are undoubtedly dark and may require a considerable price, say, a small part of the caster`s soul. However, we are ready to pay this price, I will pay it myself if necessary</r>
      <r p="sc4">And there is more. But I can only tell the rest after I see the Book with my own eyes. Magicians from the Ministry of Style who studied the Book classified results of their research, we only got small pieces of data. But this is what doesn`t surprise me at all. Both the Book and the knowledge contained in it are certainly very dangerous</r>
      <r p="lp1">Well, professor, now I can better see the whole picture. Good luck with your research!</r>

      <r p="lp2">Calamity? What are you doing here?</r>
      <r p="calam">Howdy, @lp! Didn`t expect me here, huh? Glad t` see ya, pipsqueak!</r>
      <r p="vel">While you were at the Stable, the Watcher warned everypony his sprite bots could get about the imminent invasion. To our surprise, in response the "Prancing Pony" camp offered to unite forces</r>
      <r p="calam">Well, ayep, sorta</r>
      <r p="lp2">"Unite forces"? With who?</r>
      <r p="vel">With SteelHooves` steel rangers... and Covertsign residents. The zebras living here decided they had been hiding long enough</r>
      <r p="calam">Our folks were all down for it, @lp. Our squad of the best shooters should already be approaching the rangers camp</r>
      <r p="lp1">That`s good, I suppose... but why, Calamity? What are you counting on? The Enclave is a powerful enemy, and we may be defeated</r>
      <r p="calam">So wha`, should we be sittin` nice and quiet? Your friend with the sprite bot here said that Enclave will take revenge on everypony, and ya know, I believe him. I used to be there mahself, I know their habits</r>
      <r p="vel">You were the Enclave`s soldier?!</r>
      <r p="calam">Captain Deadshot Calamity, retired. At your service. You can jus` call me "cap", Ah won`t mind</r>
      <r p="lp1">Why did you leave?</r>
      <r p="calam">Well, ya know, ya saw their ways yourself. I left a long time ago, before they even started talkin` about the surface, but still... Believe me, @lp, they didn`t mean anything good for us in any case.
You may say this`s personal for me now</r>
      <r p="lp1">You could just leave. Go somewhere far away. Especially you, Calamity, because if you know the Enclave so well, you could show a place where its troops wouldn`t find you</r>
      <r p="calam">Ain`t our way, @lp. And we have nowhere to go Ah reckon. And yet, we all know one pony that wouldn`t do that.
You know, @lp, you may not notice anythin`, but many folks follow your example. Ah wasn`t even surprised when Ah found out that you also managed to help zebras and rangers. We had somepony to talk about</r>
      <r p="lp4">...
	Thank you</r>
      <r p="lp1">But still, it was my actions that provoked the Enclave. You are all in danger now because of me</r>
      <r p="calam">Forget it, @lp. Ah`m tellin` ya. If these soldiers came down here, it means they ain`t gonna leave by their own will. Believe me, Ah know. Ya didn`t provoke anythin`</r>
      <r p="calam">It is all `bout resources, wars are always fought because of `em. Pegasi lived behind the clouds for a long time, but it couldn`t go on forever. Ya know, there is neither metal nor coal in the clouds, and, speakin` frankly, not much food either. They would start an invasion anyway, if not now than next year</r>
      <r p="vel">Calamity flew here to coordinate actions with Covertsign. But Askari should also be approaching the Steel rangers` camp, @lp. SteelHooves has a plan on how to unite our forces</r>
      <r p="lp1">Very well, but why do zebras want war? They were planning to move north</r>
      <r p="vel">Actually, I convinced them</r>
      <r p="lp2">??!</r>
      <r p="vel">The zebras here are hoping for the best, but in fact, going north is almost certain death for most of them. Fighting here for on opportunity to stay is more or less their only real chance to survive</r>
      <r p="lp2">But you have always been against violence. What changed now?</r>
      <r p="vel">Nothing. But when it comes to choosing between war and certain death... I`m not a fool, @lp. And surface ponies deserve living much more than these feathered militarists. The best option would be not fighting at all, but since it is not possible, it`s better to be the first ones to take up arms.
Also, Calamity noted that you were an example to many in his camp. Trust me, you are an example here as well</r>
      <r p="calam">Your friend is right, @lp. Ah say, if there were more like ya and her, life would have been better here in the Wasteland</r>
      <r p="calam">Look, @lp, Ah`m flyin` to join everypony at the council. Oak told us about SteelHooves, if he was tellin` the truth, it`s worth listenin` to what he`s plannin` there. And Ah think it would be nice if ya show up as well</r>
      <r p="vel">Your fighting skills may come in handy. Don`t worry about us, @lp, we have ponies here capable of organizing work</r>
      <r p="lp1">Velvet, about Mentor...</r>
      <r p="vel">He refused, didn`t he? Decided to lock up and sit quiet, hoping that Stable Pi would remain untouched? This doesn`t surprise me, @lp. He would never have courage to defend those in need. Don`t blame yourself for that</r>
      <r p="lp1">Right. Then I think I`ll join Calamity. If there is anything I can help SteelHooves with, I`ll do it, promise</r>
      <r p="vel">I have no doubt about that</r>

      <t>War council</t>
      <r p="sh">Greetings @lp. I have to admit, you managed to surprise me yet again. Thanks to you and your friends, I suddenly got new allies</r>
      <r p="vr">... as well as new enemies</r>
      <r p="wat">Calamity said that you have already been brought up to speed. Let`s not waste time</r>
      <r p="sh">Alright. As I was saying, we are on the same boat now, therefore we have common enemies. If we plan to conduct joint military operations, we need to deal with current threats first, and do this before the Enclave makes its move. We need to attack and capture Fort Rocks</r>
      <r p="sh">You might assume that I`m trying to use you to get rid of competitors. However, I suggest to think about this: the followers of now dead Coldsight and the Caesar Legion are waging an implacable war against my rangers, and it won`t stop until one of us surrenders. If we don`t end the war now, my opponents will use the nearest opportunity to stab us in our backs at the most unfavorable moment</r>
      <r p="vr">I must add that the territory around our fortifications is constantly crawling with Legion scouts. I regret to admit that none of our measures succeeded in eliminating this threat. This means that no matter what decision we make today, Caesar will be informed of our contact with you. You are all on their threat list</r>
      <r p="sh">Thank you scribe. However, the situation is not as bad as it may seem. My troops at the moment have achieved significant territorial and numerical superiority over the enemy. Strictly speaking, the enemy has already lost. We just need to finish off the remnants of its resistance. Which brings us back to Fort Rocks. Currently, this pre-war fortress serves as headquarters of the Coldsight`s Rangers and the only citadel remaining in their hooves. It is where they concentrated their main forces, as well as significant reinforcements from the Legion. The remaining detachments are scattered at several military bases and observation posts. The assault on Fort Rocks would be a strike that will make the enemy unable to fight any longer</r>
      <r p="wat">With all respect, star paladin, Fort Rocks is one of Equestria`s most powerful fortresses in all its history. Its walls are impregnable, and its artillery is overwhelming. If we attempt an assault with all forces available to us, it would be a massacre. I suppose you have a different plan?</r>
      <r p="sh">Indeed, a front attack is in no way acceptable. Before we received the news of the imminent arrival of the Enclave, I hoped to starve this fortress, but now this is no longer an option as well. Therefore, we have to rely on a different plan of action. To be honest, it is risky, but we have no other solution. Please, scribe Amaranth</r>
      <r p="vr">We have a fairly detailed plan of the fortress and we know in detail the principles of its functioning. Fort Rocks is equipped with the most advanced artillery systems that Equestria managed to create before its demise. This means that all driving and charging mechanisms of the guns operate on electric servos. Same goes for the main gates. In case of a power outage, all defensive mechanisms are equipped with capacious batteries, but after two hundred years they suffered irreparable damage from environmental conditions. We have long abandoned all attempts to fix them. Therefore, if you disconnect the mechanisms from a direct energy source, they will stop functioning</r>
      <r p="ze1">Simply put, if you turn off the generators - the guns will become silent, right?</r>
      <r p="vr">Absolutely. At the moment, all systems are powered by a single power plant. The problem is that it is located inside the fort. To shut it down, you have to get inside. We will have to rely on a saboteur who could pass the fortress walls, get to the power station and cut the power</r>
      <r p="calam">And that`s the catch, right? Ya know, Ah don`t see how this can be done. Ah reckon Ah could try flyin` over the wall with a lil bomb...</r>
      <r p="vr">This could work, but, unfortunately, the fort is equipped with anti-air guns. Attempting to reach the target with the bomb will surely fail, and rising with such a load beyond reach of the air defense systems would be much more than any pegasus is capable of</r>
      <r p="sh">We also do not possess any artillery capable of sending a projectile at a higher distance than range of the fortress cannons. That`s why I`m asking your suggestions</r>
      <r p="ze1">Perhaps I have a solution.
	In ancient times, even before my homeland was in a war against yours, we often had to oppose enemies who relied on their strongholds. We know a way to defeat them. Our shamans invented a potion that can turn one into another creature for a short time. His soul and mind will remain the same, but his body will change. Our chosen warriors thus turned into mice, birds or insects, penetrated fortresses, and then, after returning to their normal shape, opened gates from the inside. Our alchemist, Zambezi, stores one portion of this potion just for such cases</r>
      <r p="vr">I don`t think we can rely on some shaman brews</r>
      <r p="sh">We heard you, scribe. Chief Askari, are there any restrictions or difficulties in using this potion?</r>
      <r p="ze1">Yes, there are. The first is the time of its action. The potion prepared by the strongest shamans of antiquity could sustain a warrior in a different shape for several days, but we can hardly count on more than a few minutes. The second - a warrior in the guise of a small animal, although being less noticeable, will at the same time be very weak and vulnerable. But then he will be able to penetrate the fortress through any crack, pipe or even a rat hole, which no pony would care to guard</r>
      <r p="sh">Hmm... although I don`t really like this option, I must admit that we simply have no other choice. It remains to be decided who will become our saboteur</r>
      <r p="lp1">I can become one. If it helps us win, I`m in</r>
      <r p="sh">Brave words, @lp. Given the abilities you demonstrated in battle, I believe you can be entrusted with this mission. However, if you change your mind, I won`t hold anything against you. For many here you are a good acquaintance or even a friend</r>
      <r p="lp1">Still I will go</r>
      <r p="calam">Ah can pull it out later when the job`s done. Since all the guns are on electricity, that means the anti-aircraft guns as well</r>
      <r p="sh">So, does anypony have any objection to this plan? None? All agreed?
Then this is decided. We shall notice the moment the guns are shut down. Our assault squads should be ready to strike immediately, without giving the enemy time to restore the station. With the guns powered down and the gates unlocked it will be too easy. Let`s do this!</r>

      <r p="lp2">So... how did it go?</r>
      <r p="ze1">We won!</r>
      <r p="sh">Everything went according to plan. We marched to the fortress the very moment the guns were powered down, and were able to get to the gate before the enemy could block them by hooves. After we successfully entered the citadel, most of the rangers laid down their arms, and only the Legion zebras attempted an escape. However, with the only way out being under our control, this turned out to be impossible</r>
      <r p="calam">Yeehaw! That`s how we do it in Wasteland!</r>
      <r p="lp4">Does this mean that enemies are going to capitulate now?</r>
      <r p="sh">We can`t tell for sure. However, it`s a fact that even if the remaining forces loyal to Coldsight and their allies decide to continue the fight, they no longer have opportunity to do us any serious harm. Now their scattered and relatively small groups don`t even have an overall command. We may not be afraid of them stabbing our back in the ensuing war with the Enclave</r>

      <r p="lp2">Quick, tell me what happened here?</r>
      <r p="sc3">They attacked us, pegasi in strange armor...
We all were minding our own business, everything as usual. Suddenly we heard a rumble and the ground shuddered. The general alert sounded and stopped. We think they blew up the outer wall, and then somehow got access to the Stable door mechanism and our security system. I don`t understand how this is possible... And five minutes later a real nightmare began! They burst inside, killing everypony in their path!</r>
      <r p="sc3">Fortunately, after the first explosion Mentor understood that this was an attack from outside and managed to warn everypony on speakerphone. We hope that most of stable residents took refuge in workshops and labs. You know, they have their own autonomous defense systems, force fields or armored doors. However, what`s the point? There are no supplies, no food, no weapons. No matter how long we sit there, sooner or later they will get us</r>
      <r m="1" p="lp5">Motherfucking cunts! You were attacked by the Enclave, and this enemy is just fucking strong!|Discord`s spawn! You were attacked by the Enclave, and this enemy is just frickin` strong!</r>
      <r p="lp2">Where`s Mentor?</r>
      <r p="sc3">He is wounded, @lp... Mortally wounded, I`m afraid. We retreated here, to workshop one, because it was here we were working on the "Sun" project. We stumbled upon a group of enemies. Mentor got a plasma bolt right in his chest. I managed to cast a mass daze spell and, while enemy was coming to their senses, dragged him here, under the protection of the field. However I`m afraid he still isn`t going to survive</r>
      <r p="lp5">But why didn`t you use the Alicorn Armor? Is it not ready?</r>

      <r p="sc4">Holy Celestia. How many ponies died</r>
      <r p="vel">Ponies, zebras. Earth ponies, unicorns... pegasi</r>
      <r p="ze1">And this is not the end</r>
      <r p="sh">But at least we`ll have a break. Losing their flagship and most of the accompanying strike group stunned the enemy. To such extent that, according to our reports, they suspended military operations in other regions</r>
      <r p="calam">Ayep. We haven`t had such losses... They. They haven`t had such losses since... Well, never, Ah reckon. We haven`t won yet, `f course. But now they`re gonna have a mighty commotion up there, in the clouds</r>
      <r p="wat">We are here to honor the mentor of @lp and Velvet. I think a discussion of the strategy should be left for later</r>
      <r p="sc4">A mentor, a colleague. For some, a friend. We all lost friends and ponies we know. Now is the time to honor one of them</r>
      <r>*HERE LIES
SILVER MANE
A pony who wanted to bring back the past*</r>
      <r p="lp1">May Celestia embrace his soul</r>
      <r p="wat">He was not alone in his aspirations. Many ponies I knew wished for the same thing</r>
      <r p="vel">But not everypony understood this was impossible</r>
      <r p="sc4">The past... The past perished with him</r>
      <r p="sh">No. We all stand on a foundation of the past. It defines us and makes us what we are. And it eventually brought us all here</r>
      <r p="lp1">I wonder... Could things have been different? If the Mentor hadn`t send us to the surface, if I hadn`t found artifacts. And if... not for the events at the Enclave`s base</r>
      <r p="calam">Who knows. Ah`d say that it could have been different. But not much different. All that would happen sooner or later</r>
      <r p="wat">Perhaps. Stable Pi couldn`t stay sealed forever. Sooner or later this was to happen, one way or another</r>
      <r p="ze1">But there is something that could never happen then. We could never meet ponies who were ready to face horrors of the Wasteland and wouldn`t let it devour themselves. Ponies who would refuse to accept the order of things in this world. And which would give us hope for a better future</r>
      <r p="wat">Truly so. This world has long been bogged down in despair and misery. But while there are those who believe in a better world, hope remains</r>

      <r p="calam">Hey, @lp. Ah know this may not be the best time, but, ya know, you sure did great job smashin` that Thunderhead into pieces! That armor - is that the project for which they sent you here to us?</r>
      <r p="lp1">Yes, even though I didn`t remember about it. I think Mentor had other plans than to use this exoskeleton in the war against Enclave</r>
      <r p="calam">Yeah. But it really helped us a lot. Well, ya did, Ah mean. Does it still work?</r>
      <r p="lp3">I don`t think it will ever function as good as before. But at least it can still fly</r>
      <r p="calam">That ain`t bad too. Listen, remember how Ah suggested ya to put down roots in our good ol` Prancin`? If ya don`t change your mind, mah deal is still on the table</r>
      <r p="lp1">I don`t know yet. But thanks. At least I will definitely stop by from time to time. Especially first time until we defeat the Enclave</r>
      <r p="calam">Ya know, `bout that. Ah ain`t gonna explain everythin` in detail, but perhaps there won`t be any war for some time. We have a complex society above the clouds, and the Enclave is not that all-powerful there at all. Perhaps after such losses it will even be swept away. Or maybe not. But it will definitely have problems besides us</r>

      <r p="calam">Well, it`s still uncertain. We shall see Ah reckon. When everythin` settles down, come visit us, we`ll do some flyin` together. It`s been a long time since I was flyin` with any of my friends</r>

      <r p="lp1">And yet this is actually my fault</r>
      <r p="vel">Yes, it`s your fault too.
But the blame lies with me as well. After all, it was me who, as a result of my refusal, forced Mentor to send a new Chosen one to the surface. If not for me, you would have stayed home. And who knows what would have happened if I had fulfilled my mission</r>
      <r p="lp1">...</r>
      <r p="lp1">If you could return to the past, to the day you volunteered to become Chosen, would you agree to go to the surface anyway, knowing what awaits you here?</r>
      <r p="vel">Of course. After all that I saw on the surface, my desire fix at least something here only grew stronger. It will be a long way, @lp, a very long way. But if I don`t believe that we can bring peace back with these ponies, I don`t know what to believe in at all</r>
      <r p="vel">I will help Stable ponies here. It will be very difficult for them now, after and discovering a completely new world and loosing so many ponies. But when things get back to normal, I will return to Covertsign zebras. They need me. And what are you going to do?</r>
      <r p="lp1">I have no choice. I owe Equestrian Wasteland too much. We already talked about it, remember? Now that I saw this place with my own eyes, I can`t abandon ponies here. So do you</r>

  <txt id="dialEnd_wat" v="0.8">
    <n>
      <r p="lp1">There is much you never told me about yourself. Perhaps the time has come?</r>
      <r p="wat">I don`t think this is important</r>
      <r p="lp2">But still?</r>
      <r p="wat">...
	As I said before, I have been in touch with your Stable for a very long time. You know, these days, almost two hundred years after the War, life in the Wasteland is no picnic at all, but then, during the first decades, it was absolutely terrible. At some point, I thought that I would become the last intelligent being. Therefore, I tried to find such islands of civilization as your home, and protect them. I helped them, talked about what was happening around, warned of dangers. I was hoping that when the time comes for Stable Pi to open its doors, it wouldn`t be... like that</r>
      <r p="lp2">Why didn`t you persuade us to open up to the world? Our help could save lives of so many ponies here</r>
      <r p="wat">And many ponies would want your death. Believe me @lp, many times I`ve seen how stables like yours unsealed only to be destroyed or enslaved. I did not want such a fate befall you</r>
      <r p="lp1">What were you hoping for? Why did you think it would become better later on?</r>
      <r p="wat">I didn`t think it would be better. I was just hoping. And tried to find the right ponies.
Remember, I lived before the War and knew many... amazing ponies. It`s hard to believe now, but @lp, there are ponies who can change the world. Even now, in our harsh times, there is hope that sooner or later they will come and turn everything upside down here</r>
      <r p="wat">But such ponies are one in a million and are extremely difficult to meet. However, there are still those who are changing this world for the better. Askari said a right thing about you. You and Velvet - you do not accept this world. You want to change it, you want to help those brought on the brink of survival, having to deal with new dangers every day. And you are succeeding</r>
      <r p="lp1">These are very kind words. But in the end, my invasion of the Enclave base started a war in which hundreds have died already. If I changed the world, it`s not for the best at all</r>
      <r p="wat">This`s just how it seems to you. You probably didn`t notice, but your and Velvet`s actions brought hope to surface ponies. In their life they saw too much evil, cruelty and indifference. Many began forgetting that everything could be different. With your selfess help and dedication you reminded them that it can</r>
      <r p="wat">Every story should have a moral, right? Perhaps for the story of Stable Pi it would`ve been like this: "The road to hell is paved with good intentions." It is unfortunate that it all ended so. But as for you... Your story is not finished yet. And I think I should help you write it</r>
      <r p="lp4">Then, I suppose, you should start by telling yours in more detail</r>
      <r p="wat">Sounds fair. Yes, I think I will tell you my story in due time. Or even better - I`ll invite to my place when this war is over. Are we agreed?</r>
      <r p="lp4">Agreed</r>

      <r p="lp1">I was told that you have been living for two hundred years already. Is this true?</r>
      <r p="sh">Yes, it is true. It just so happened that I became a ghoul. A Canterlot ghoul, to be exact. I was lucky to keep my sanity, and unlucky to see this world slipping into the abyss of madness and devastation</r>
      <r p="lp1">So you saw Equestria before the war?</r>
      <r p="sh">Yes. And I know what you`re thinking @lp. You are right, the sky is now exactly the same as it used to be then.
Good times...</r>

      <r p="sh">I don`t know. I have hoped so many times over the years, clutching at false promises.

      <r p="lp1">We are alive and standing here. In our situation, this is already a success</r>
      <r p="sc4">But at such a price, such a huge price... And we no longer have Alicorn Armor</r>
      <r p="lp1">Can we fixed it?</r>
      <r p="sc4">No... A hasty launch at low power turned out to be fatal for it. The quantum cogitator could not stand the damage, and the Alicorn amulet, apparently, completely lost its power. Only the skeleton remains, a pale imitation of the real thing! For two hundred years we all have been working so hard to complete the project, and now we are here, among the graves of our comrades, whom we have failed. All our work was in vain</r>
      <r p="lp1">Pull yourself together, professor. If we hadn`t done this, we all would`ve perished. It`s hard for me to say this, but this is how you get iron will. Many of us have a burden of guilt, and for some it`s very heavy. But we must live on. Stable Pi must survive</r>
      <r p="sc4">... Yes. Yes, you are right.
We have a lot of work to do. Those invaders not only killed ponies, they did serious damage to the stable. We need to recover, and first of all we need to find a way to protect ourselves in the future</r>
      <r p="lp1">A new project?</r>
      <r p="sc4">A new project? I don`t think so. It would not be possible... We have to come up with something else</r>
      <r p="lp1">What about the Black Book? I can leave it with you, maybe you can find a use for it</r>
      <r p="sc4">Oh, no-no-no, keep it to yourself. While I was working with this thing, I seemed to begin hallucinating. You`d better throw it away altogether - zebras weren`t afraid of such witchcraft for nothing</r>
      <r p="lp1">Perhaps we should seek help from our new allies?</r>
      <r p="sc4">Perhaps. This is not for me to decide. We won`t be deciding anything now, first we must pay respects to those who are not with us anymore</r>

      <r p="lp1">What do you think, how did the Enclave manage to find Stable Pi so easily, and even open the outer door without any effort?</r>
      <r p="sc1">You know, this bothers me since the day of the attack. Of course, I didn`t have much time, but I still did some digging through the archives</r>
      <r p="lp1">And what did you find out?</r>
      <r p="sc1">It turns out that all this time we were very naive, believing that the location of the Stable was unknown to everypony else. Well, think for yourself how much effort is required to build it, how many workers involved, how much equipment, supplies... and all this was documented somewhere, and too many knew about it. Of course, with the devastation that is happening now on the surface, all this information has long been lost and forgotten. But the Enclave is a different matter. Judging by what I know about them, they have preserved many pre-war databases. All they had to do to find a location of any Stable was just make right inquiries</r>
      <r p="lp1">And how did they open the door? After all, it was designed to withstand even mega-spells</r>
      <r p="sc1">At first I thought that they hacked the security system from an external terminal. But it was nothing of the kind. They simply had access codes! It turns out that an external door of any Stable can be opened by entering such codes. And we didn`t even know such thing exists. Well, that is, I didn`t know... Mentor should have known, but for some reason he didn`t take any precautions. Just mechanically blocking the door would be enough. I assume, there were some rules forbidding it from two centuries ago</r>
      <r p="sc1">But I promise you, everything will be different now. I will personally reorganize the entire security system. This will not happen again</r>

      <r p="lp2">What is that?</r>
      <r p="zetr">The Black book. The news that this damned thing was in hooves of a wrong pony reached me too late</r>
      <r p="lp1">It was necessary for completing the project</r>
      <r p="zetr">Of course it was necessary. Just as it was necessary for all those unfortunate souls it has destroyed before. Necessity brings all of you to the Black Book. But it will never give you what you desire</r>
      <r p="lp1">However the project was completed, and the armor helped protect my home from the invaders</r>
      <r p="zetr">Invaders? Have you ever heard of those invaders before the damned book revealed itself?
Remember @lp. Remember what happened to you and your loved ones since you got this thing. How many times did you feel happy? Or did threats and sorrows start falling on you, as if from under the hoof of the Mare of The Stars? Have you been yourself?</r>
      <r p="lp2">You are telling me, that...</r>
      <r p="zetr">Fate is incomprehensible to us mortals. But such artifacts, creations of insane minds, stand above the world of living. They can change it like clay in hooves of a skilled potter - sublty, but inexorably. If you want to live in peace the rest of your life, stay away from this evil thing</r>
      <r p="lp1">This is... too strange to be true. No, it`s nonsense. Sorry, Zambezi, this book may be disastrous, but I won`t leave such a powerful artifact just lying around somewhere</r>
      <r p="zetr">This mistake might cost you dearly in the future. But I can`t force you. When the Black Book brings you to your doom and your bones are polished by desert wind, I will come and bury them. But only after I bury this damned thing deep underground</r>

      <r p="lp2">Interesting. And which one is better?</r>
      <r p="va">Each has its pros and cons. Metal protects well against bullets, collisions and laser weapons, but it`s pretty heavy and will slow you down. The leather armor is light, it will protect from fire, monsters` fangs and claws, but cannot really stop bullets. The choice is yours</r>
      <r p="lp3">And what if I wear both? You know, leather under metal?</r>

      <r p="lp3">Well, something different from standard armor?</r>
      <r p="va">There is no such thing as "standard armor", all types I know have their own characteristics. But I understand what you mean. My old friend Wolf once gave me schematics to make armor from the shells of radscorpions. As you probably know, their chitinous shells are very strong, yet light and flexible, which makes them an excellent material. However I never found time to experiment on this, and I don`t know if I ever will. So, if you want, I can sell you a copy for a very reasonable price</r>

      <r p="lp4">Show me, what have you got there?</r>
      <r p="va">A well-preserved sample of developments by MWT. Polymer-ceramic plates, fireproof fabric with kevlar lining. It is cut so that id doesn`t hinder your movements. Ideal for medium and short range combat conditions against opponents with firearms</r>
      <r p="lp2">And what about protection against energy weapons?</r>
      <r p="va">Well, not so great. This armor was created even before such weapons became widely used</r>
      <r p="va">However, if you need protection from magical energy blasts, I can help you. In the warehouse I have an unsold magic armor set. It was created specifically to counter such weapons and copes well with the protection of the carrier from lasers, plasma and electricity. If you plan visiting a military plant or another place with a bunch of robots, this armor is the best choice</r>
      <r p="lp3">So, if I put on a combat armor, and on top of it - a magic one a couple of sizes larger, will I be protected from everything?</r>

      <r p="vw">I prefer good old firearms. It is cheaper, more reliable, easier to maintain, and can work where magical energy won`t - like underwater. But the problem is that there are a lot of different calibers, and ammo from one gun, most likely, will not fit another. Well, what can you do</r>
      <r p="vw">Magical energy weapons, however, use standard spark-batteries, which are suitable for anything, and this, I must say, is very convenient.

      <r p="vd">Welcome to the clinic of Doc Sepsis (it`s me, for your information). Wide spectrum of medical services. Treatment of wounds, contusions, fractures, radiation sickness and (my specialization) blood infection</r>
      <r p="lp4">Hi, Doc, I`m @lp. This place doesn`t look much like a clinic</r>
      <r p="vd">Yet it`s the best you can find in this area. When you are shot by a raider, or bitten by a wild ghoul - and this sure happens sooner or later - you`ll have nothing else left to do but to come to me. Only then you`ll be able to see the real value of this place</r>
      <r p="lp1">And why can`t I just use healing potions?</r>
      <r p="vd">...</r>
      <r p="vd" push="1">You`re not very strong in medicine, aren`t you? "Healing potions" as you called them are nothing more than potent reparative drugs. If you get a serious injury, say a fracture or a concussion, your only chance to recover is a good doctor with a medical equipment required...</r>
      <r p="lp2">Repra.. what drugs?</r>
      <r p="vd">Reparative, meaning regenerating. In short - your body always tries to recover to its normal state, curing on its own various cuts, bruises and so on, and reparative drugs speed up this process several times. But if you are injured, with which the body can not cope on its own, your potions will not be able to help you any more</r>
      <r p="vd">I see you have a PipBuck? This device must have a medical module that monitors user`s health. Of course, you can notice a sticking bone or a deep cut yourself, but a working medical module is able to control all the processes in your body and compare them with the normal condition. That is, it will notice that something is wrong with you, even if you feel fine</r>
      <r p="vd">Aha, It`s not even on! Just a moment...</r>
      <r mod="1">The medical module is now available in PipBuck. [Status] tab - [Health]</r>
      <r p="vd">All set! The service cost is a hundred caps. Just kidding, I won`t take money for this. But just in case, here, get acquainted with the price list for medical services</r>
      <r p="lp2">Wow, your prices are not small</r>
      <r p="vd">They can`t be small. If you think that medications are cheap, I am sorry to disappoint you. Almost all the money that I receive go to the purchase of new medicines and equipment, I leave only a meager part to myself. And if my clinic goes belly up because I keep low prices, guess who lose the most from this</r>
      <r p="vd">However, I`m not a monster, you know. When you happen to be dying without any caps to pay me, you can count on a couple of treatments free of charge. But only for the first time. It`s not nice to profit from somepony else`s kindness</r>

      <r p="lp2">What? But I don`t want to become a cyborg at all!</r>
      <r p="vd">If you picture it as iron hoofs and eyes instead of normal ones, then no, I`m not going to saw your leg off to attach a cyber-leg in its place. My implants are invisible and do not cause any loss in mobility or sensitivity of the client</r>
      <r p="lp1">Suppose I agree. What is required of me?</r>
      <r p="vd">Just your money. You pay for the implant, I bring you into a state of general anesthesia and perform the operation. You close your eyes, and when you open them again, you will have the new implant and new abilities</r>
      <r p="lp2">You are not going to stub me, are you?</r>
      <r p="vd">I don`t make mistakes in my work, otherwise I wouldn`t be here. And specifically, I definitely will not kill a goose that lays golden eggs. You can calm down your paranoia. By the way, I also provide psychiatrist services, be my guest</r>

      <r p="vm">I also craft and sell melee weapons. Well, you know - everything that can cut, stab and smash, from knives to sledgehammers. Unlike firearms or magical energy weapons, it does not require ammunition, never jams or misfires. You just need to know how to use it</r>
      <r p="lp2">And can I make weapons myself?</r>
      <r p="vm">Of course! To begin with, you will need schematics. Unless you are able inventing things right in your head, of course. Schematics can be bought from masters, and you can try your luck search in different places in the wasteland - in abandoned buildings, in safes, desks or bookcases. If air in the room was dry, and the paper is good, maybe it won`t fall apart right in your hooves. Sometimes I can also share some with you</r>
      <r p="vm">Then, if you have all the required parts, and you hoofs are in the right place, the weapons can be assembled on a workbench, like the one I have here in my workshop</r>

      <r p="vs">On the contrary. If you want to become a magician, I can help you and teach you the real magic. But you must develop the magical power yourself, you can not master this art until you learn to draw magic from yourself. Visit me sometimes, I will watch changes in your potential and teach you new spells when you are ready</r>

      <r p="lp4">Oh, yes, the best orb I`ve ever seen! Does it predict the future?</r>
      <r p="vs">It can do that, too. But you can use it for other purposes - to change your appearance. Worry not, it is just an illusion that only you can see. Your friends will not notice anything and will recognize you just like before</r>

And one cannot achieve the proper level of armor coverage and insulation with the equipment in my workshop... But anyway, it`s the best you can offer to one who likes playing with explosives</r>

      <t v="0.8">Valuable gun</t>
      <r p='lp1'>How did you lose your gun?</r>
      <r p='vw'>It`s not so simple. In fact, it`s not just about a gun:</r>
      <r p='vw'>The last time I was on business in Manehattan, I was out of luck. Got caught by the slavers. So they put shackles on me and put in cage with other slaves. Well, of course they took everything, including the gun. A great pistol, by the way, but what`s more important, this pistol was a family relic. Got it from my father</r>
      <r p='vw'>But it`s hard to take me down with bare hoofs, and I managed to escape. Although, of course, I was very lucky then. But all my stuff remained with them, I didn`t have time to take it back...</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Since then those slavers are long gone for sure</r>
      <r p='vw'>Oh no, they aren`t. I would not worry so much about them even because of the family gun. When I was sitting in a cage, I heard a lot of their babbling. The place where they took me serves as a transit camp, and they have already been sitting there for several years. And it is guarded by the same group. Slave traders use this base to raid nearby settlements and even trade routes. If you destroy this camp, it will undermine their work for weeks, if not months</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Anything else you can tell me?</r>
      <r p='vw'>Their chief`s name - Chopper. Surely he took my gun. When you kill him - scrape his pockets, perhaps my gun is still with him. You do not sell such rare stuff</r>

      <r p='lp4'>I am afraid he`s not feeling well lately</r>
      <r p='vw'>Suits him right! Listen, it would be unfair if I took such a fine weapon as "Loyalty" from you without giving something equal in return. Take this one, it is no worse</r>

      <r p='vw'>Oh, my mare mother! Is it really the Gun? Yes, it definitely is, those energy cells that I have are made using the same technology</r>
      <r p='vw'>And so, it works? Did you try it in action?</r>
      <r p='lp4'>I sure did! I`ve never seen a weapon more powerful. It is somewhat similar to an ordinary laser pistol, but 10 times cooler!</r>
      <r p='lp3'>Only there is a problem with ammunition. Conventional batteries do not fit. Listen, you said you have energy cells for it? Can I buy them?</r>
      <r p='vw'>Well, just take them for free, I don`t need them anyway. And just one look at such a miracle was worth it</r>
      <r p='lp4'>Thank you very much, I will find them a good use. And do you think this blaster really fell from the stars?</r>
      <r p='vw'>Don`t know. Perhaps this was a secret project from the past, or maybe pegasi lost it? Who knows what they are doing there behind the clouds. But if they have such weapons... we might have a big problem. We shall see</r>

      <r p='lp4'>Hey, Doc! And what about this strange robot standing in the corner?</r>
      <r p='vd'>This is the AutoDoc - a pre-war, fully automated medical station. It is equipped with a diagnostic module and a full spectrum of surgical instruments. In fact, it can cure you of many diseases and injuries all by itself, no doctor participation is required</r>
      <r p='lp1'>But, by the looks of it, now it doesn`t work?</r>
      <r p='vd'>Correct. It used to be glitching even before - it`s a very old one really. And a year ago it broke down completely. Winry does not know how to fix such equipment, and in repairs she is better that nopony else among us. I tried asking some travelling merchants, but you can figure the result. Since then it`s just standing there collecting dust</r>
      <r p='vd'>Perhaps you understand mechanics better than medicine?</r>
      <r p='lp3'>I can try... but what will I get if I fix it?</r>
      <r p='vd'>I`ll let you use AutoDoc for free. In working condition, it is able to compete even with my skills, no matter how much I would like to say otherwise, so you will not regret it. The only thing - this device uses the so-called biogel for operations</r>
      <r p='lp2'>What`s biogel?</r>
      <r p='vd'>It is a complex biochemical composition that accelerates tissue regeneration. AutoDoc uses it to heal wounds and close cuts after surgery without stitching, and synthesize stimulating biomass, which in its characteristics corresponds to healing potions. Without it, an AutoDoc could only cut your stomach open and leave it like that. I have some biogel left, and I`ll give it to you if you bring the AutoDoc back life</r>

      <r p='vd'>I already know that. How should I explain... Let`s just say that all the time that you were tinkering with the machine, I was in the same room sitting next to you. At a distance of half a meter. Do you understand what I`m getting at?</r>
      <r p='vd'>But thank you for the job well done. Patching up the AutoDoc is a very significant contribution to the functioning of my clinic. As promised, from now on you have every right to use the AutoDoc absolutely free of charge and not even pay for electricity consumption. In addition, here are all 5 liters of biogel that I have left. If you need more, you can try to search it among the ruins of pre-war clinics or pharmaceutical factories, other sources of biogel still do not exist</r>
      <r p='lp3'>And what about a little discount for medical services?</r>
      <r p='vd'>Well, no, it was not a part of our agreement. I have one price for all, and there can be no other way</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Then at least a fraction of biogel that you receive?</r>
      <r p='vd'>I can`t tell now if I`ll ever have any biogel at all. And if I have, then I need to save some for my customers, right? And I won`t be getting it for free, so no. Maximum - I`ll sell you some, but don`t really count on that</r>

      <t v="0.8">About tools</t>
      <r p='lp2'>Quite a lot of instruments you have here</r>
      <r p='vm'>Naturally, this Is a workshop. But in reality, I lack many of the most needed tools</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Which ones exactly? Perhaps I will be able to find them somewhere?</r>
      <r p='vm'>If you find them, I`ll give you a nice reward. But don`t think that the tools I need can be found in any closet. These are not just some screwdrivers. Now listen:
First, I need calipers</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Is it a tool for accurate size measurement?</r>
      <r p='vm'>Exactly. Using it you can precisely determine, for example, diameter of a bolt or a nut. Try looking in an abandoned factory, I`m sure that there these tools were widely used there. But so far no one has ever found this for me</r>
      <r p='vm'>Second, I need a hydraulic bolt cutter. It is a tool that can easily cut, well, a thick metal rod for example</r>
      <r p='lp2'>Must be a useful thing. Where can I find it?</r>
      <r p='vm'>Well, it could be found in the factory, probably. But there is one more option. Many years ago this workshop belonged to another mechanic. I know for sure that he had a hydraulic bolt cutter. Once he took it and went to the old sewers, no idea why, maybe he wanted to open some kind of grate. In any case, he never returned from there</r>
      <r p='lp1'>I can`t promise anything, somehow I don`t feel like repeating his sacrifice</r>
      <r p='vm'>I understand, never had such a desire myself. Finally, I need an oscilloscope. Well, you know, an instrument for measuring various parameters of an electrical signal</r>
      <r p='lp3'>Yes, we had one in our stable. If I come across a working one, I bring it to you at once</r>
      <r p='vm'>If you find something, bring it right away. Of course, I will pay well for every instrument you find</r>

      <r p='lp2'>I`m pretty good at this, why?</r>
      <r p='vm'>You see, I`m somewhat interested in everything connected with robots. I`m especially curious about equidroids. Heard about them? They are robots that look like real ponies</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Go on</r>
      <r p='vm'>They usually behave somewhat aggressively, but it`s not their fault. And initially they were not like that. Do you know that originally their software simulated pony personality?</r>
      <r p='lp1'>No, I didn`t. Is it true?</r>
      <r p='vm'>Yes. They are extremely rare today, but before the war there were a few places where they were used especially often. And I heard that you planned to enter one Stable near our camp, which, according to rumors, is full of various robots. Perhaps you will meet equidroids there as well</r>
      <r p='lp2'>And could it be that those robots went bananas and killed all the inhabitants?</r>
      <r p='vm'>This is quite possible, but there is nopony left to tell the story</r>
      <r p='vm'>In any case, I want to learn more about them. Whatever they might say, this is a real miracle of technology. If only we could learn how to reprogram them...</r>
      <r p='lp3'>Is it really possible? And what is required of me?</r>
      <r p='vm'>Technical documentation for equidroids and any general information about them. I think, if the Stable 88 was involved in their development, they must have kept it in their data storage. Of course, there must be information security systems, that`s why I asked you about your hacking skills</r>
      <r p='lp1'>Well, I will certainly try... But I can`t promise anything. There is a chance that I won`t be able to crack it</r>
      <r p='vm'>I have something that can help you. These are schematics for the PipBuck module, which can assist with hacking. Here you are! I believe you will have no problem with construction of this device</r>
      <r p='lp4'>Wow, this is cool! Thank you!</r>

      <r p='lp2'>I see you have a whole library here!</r>
      <r p='vs'>I wish I had... Several shelves with books, that is all. Nowadays the books are not published - there is nopony to do it.

However all I know is only rumors and references I found in other books. If you find them, for each volume you will get a special price</r>
      <r p='vs'>And also, I have one rare book that you will surely find interesting. Two copies, actually. I will give one to a pony who makes the greatest contribution for the expansion of my library. Of course, this pony might be you! Is it not wonderful?</r>

      <r p="lp1">May I ask? Steel Rangers see their mission in collecting and preserving pre-war technologies, did I understand correctly?</r>
      <r p="vr">That`s correct</r>
      <r p="lp1">And how do you do it exactly</r>
      <r p="vr">We periodically send search parties to ruins of old cities, and we also pay to stalkers, traders and scavengers if they bring us valuable items</r>
      <r p="lp1">And what are you doing with these items?</r>
      <r p="vr">We study them, assign inventory numbers and send to a warehouse</r>
      <r p="lp2">What, that`s all? You don`t even use them? Never try to reproduce them and put to use? Honestly, I still cannot understand this. Are there not enough ponies in the Wastelands that could benefit from these technologies?</r>
      <r p="vr">Do not think that you are the first one who asks this question, @lp. There are many among the Steel Rangers who would support your point of view. However, the majority believes that sharing technology with the "savages" is not only not advisable, but even dangerous for everypony. Allegedly, we should take care of future generations, preserve technology for them instead of trying to save the doomed world around us</r>
      <r p="vr">Do not rush to be indignant. I know how cynical this sounds... but no pony cares for my opinion, and even less for yours</r>
      <r p="lp1">Hmm... okay. You say that you pay for valuable pieces of technology. Is there anything you would especially like to receive?</r>
      <r p="vr">Yes ma`am. Enclave Power Armor. Have you ever seen it?</r>

      <r mod="1">Dear Reader! If you hold this opus in your hooves, that means that you have decided to take the first step in mastering the subtle art of foul language. The ability to swear firmly and ornately is actually an important and essential part of intelligent speech, and there is absolutely nothing shameful in it if used properly. In most cases, simply adding a dirty word to your speech is not enough to impress audience and fully express your feelings, and many improve their skills of conveying emotions colorfully throughout entire live. Sadly, our dictionary will unlikely be enough to raise you to the level of real maestros of this art, because the truly masterful swearing should come intuitively and from your very heart. But thanks to this book, you can definitely get a starting point that will guide you in further improving your talents in this field
This book is divided into three main sections, depending on the dirtiness and strength of the curses. If you have never encountered rude expressions before, we strongly recommend that you start reading from the very first, most decent section. All the phrases listed here are universal and can be applied in any situation to express anger, resentment or admiration.
1. Light swearing
This section gives examples of the most frequently used curses that are accepted in society as relatively civilized and acceptable for use even with foals. They will still allow you to clearly and vividly express your thoughts and your mood to the recipient.
Oh, Celestia curse you(them)!
Luna`s curses!
Oh, for Celestia`s sake!
Discord`s spawn!
Oh Goddesses!
Let you(them) choke on it!
May Luna smash your silly head!
May Celestia burn you(them)!
May Celestia and Luna bring curses upon you(them)!
May your friends abandon you!
May Discord take you!
Sweet Celestia!
Flying feathers!
May goddesses damn you!
Horseapples!
Pegasus horns!
What the hay!
</r>
      <r m="1" mod="1">
2. Profanity.
This section contains samples of swearing considered taboo in society. In most cases, it contains abusive words designed to give a phrase more rigidity and edge. We recommend resorting to them only in the presence of ponies well-known to you who will not be offended by such an expression of emotions, and categorically do not recommend using them near foals, law enforcement officers and the Overmare/Overstallion.
Fuck!
Fuckity-fuck!
Fuck it with a horn!
For fuck`s sake!
Shut the fuck up!
Go fuck yourself (themselves)!
Fuck your (their) asses with a hoof!
(addressing a stallion) Bloody dragonfucker!
Parasprite`s dick!
Bloody bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Bloody cunt!
(addressing a filly) Bloody whore!
(applicable to unicorn/stallions) Sit on my horn and spin!
Motherfucking cocksucker!
Fucked up beyond all recognition!
Kiss my ass, you shitty little motherfucking cocksucking bastard!
Hoof me the fucking keys, you cocksucker, what the fuck?
3. Blasphemy.
This part contains ugly and dirty curses, which to some extent invlove the divine princesses Celestia and Luna. Many believe that mentioning them in such an ugly and rude way is a sin in itself, and our heavenly patrons may not tolerate such an attitude towards themselves. Therefore, use them only at your own risk.
Oh fuck me with Celestia`s forehooves!
Luna rape you (them) with her horn!
Luna fuck me with the moon.
Luna shitting moon rocks!
Stick a horn where Celestia don`t shine!
Solar-flaring orgasms of Celestia!
Luna shove my cunt full of moonrocks and call me home.
Celestia clop my clit with a hoof-full of sunfire!
Luna`s tidal mareheat!
Celestia suckle me!
Celestia`s solar-flaring mareheat!
Luna clop me with Her wings.
Oh Goddesses fuck me in a three-way
Celestia`s solar-heated libido!
Luna-eclipsing orgasms!
Holy hot sex with Celestia!
Conclusion.
It does not matter what kind of curses you use and how they interact with each other. Remember that the most important thing about any swearing is its relevance. The ability to be aware of where and when you can, and where and when you shouldn`t swear will help you to maintain your culture and not be considered vulgar, at the same time creating an image of a harsh and tough pony. Therefore, it will be best if you, before starting to demonstrate the knowledge gained from your book, evaluate under what conditions your team members consider swearing appropriate and what type of curses are most common among them.
Good luck in this difficult but noble art!
Bonus material.
In truth, when our team of authors worked on this book, we did not expect to add any additional material after the conclusion. However, the opus presented below is, without a doubt, simply obliged to appear on these pages in view of its unconditional uniqueness and exceptional relevance. This text was kindly provided by a representative of the library of our Stable, who wished to remain anonymous, and is a well-documented tirade of a senior official who lived many centuries before the War. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that, with its impressive length and incredible variety of words used, it was expressed by the author without any preparation and without purpose to get into history, but only in order to reprimand the royal guard who had fallen asleep at the post. Through the efforts of Princess Celestia`s adjutant, this impromptu was preserved and recorded in its original form, and now, despite the abundance of long-obsolete words, it is certainly an example of unsurpassed mastery in the art of dirty, but such colorful and amazing swearing (and the amazing power of the lungs).
You miserable bastard, bloody pants-pissing retard, motherfucking moron, buttfucked by a timberwolf, fart-smelling maggot, balllicking wanker, frigid son of a bitchy whore, zebra-humping insect-eating asshole, Discord`s scrotum sack, Tirek`s cocksucking excuse for a guard, cyka blyat, if I ever see you sorry ass asleep at the fucking post, then, for Celestia`s sake, I am gonna shove my hoof so far up your ass the water on my knee will quench your thirst before you can even fucking say "horseshit", do you fucking understand?!  
|*The following sections contain examples of swearing so rude and indecent that even a seasoned raider could enrich his vocabulary with more than one new phrase*</r>

      <t v="0.8">Ghouls</t>
      <r mod='1'>Ghouls.
The first time I saw a ghoul was a week after losing memory. To be honest, I didn`t even understand what I saw: a terribly looking pony rushed straight at me, growling like wild animals. I barely managed to escape. Then I thought that it was just sick with some strange illness. However, a couple of days later I had an opportunity to examine these creatures closer. I was on a second floor of an old building, and there was a huge hole in the floor of one of its rooms. Through that I saw two of them below. I quietly crept to the edge and carefully studied their appearance. They were corpses, actual half-decayed corpses! They did not breathe, did not move at all, just stared blankly at the wall in front of them. Since then I tried avoiding meeting these creatures. Until I came across a camp full of quite alive and friendly ponies.
There, having become a little familiar, I began asking the inhabitants about the world around me. I learned a lot, but what`s really important, I found out that ghouls are actually have some kind of life. Yes, they are not just puppets raised by magic, they are alive! It`s strange, very strange. How can organism maintain life after such monstrous mutilation? Unfortunately, ponies in the camp couldn`t give me answers. I decided to put my questions about this into my to-do list</r>
      <r mod='1'>After I`ve learned about the Rainbow project and sent that crazy "mentor" where sun doesn`t shine, I got more time. So I returned to my questions. Unfortunately, I could learn little from ghouls` bodies: only that after owner`s death its dead tissue... well, it remains dead, not showing any life signs. I realized that to conduct a real experiment I need to work with subjects in a lab. It`s highly unlikely that ponies from the camp will be happy if I bring a smelly corpse with me and begin dissecting it. It seems that I will have to do experiments far from others.
I picked the place quickly. The old sewers underground were pretty well populated with subjects for my research. In addition, it was easy hiding from them on elevated positions, and raiders don`t wander there - the biggest danger of all I met in the Wasteland. Really, I honestly have no clue why those ponies are so cruel.
Well, the camp is doing well, and I hope that next week I will not be needed there. They are good ponies, they will be fine without me for a while. Just in case, I warned Calamiti that I am leaving for a week, so that if something happens to me, they would find me</r>
      <r mod='1'>And so I`m here. Oh, that stench, dear Celestia! But I was lucky to find a secluded place almost right away, after only a couple of hours. At this height, nopony will notice me, and if they do, zombies will never jump this high. I laid out my stuff and prepared a field lab. It`s time to do science</r>
      <r mod='1'>I caught one of them. It proved to be impossible to catch it alive (if this word is even applicable), anyway, for a start the remains will do. I carried it to my lab and covered it with a dense cloth, so that the stench wouldn`t spread too much. First I examined the tissues for presence of active processes. A detailed analysis gave the same results as the previous quick review: the natural biological processes in the body of this pony stopped a very long time ago. But this concerns not just vital functions, decomposition haven`t affected tissues that much. Parasites and molds are absent from the body. Even traces of microorganisms that decompose dead flesh are almost indistinguishable! Obviously, something is methodically destroying everything that tries to eat the flesh of a ghoul. Something...</r>
      <r mod='1'>The subsequent study of various tissues, including brain, did not reveal any biochemical differences from normal dead tissue. Mind and soul left the body of the unfortunate creature long ago. However, the interesting results came from an experiment, which I should`ve done from the very beginning: the body contains remnants of some magic. Unfortunately, because of the age of the corpse, it faded away almost completely, and I cannot determine what kind of magic it was and what an evil pony did it. The fact that the pony was evil is obvious - only a monster could commit such a mockery over nature!</r>
      <r mod='1'>I managed to capture a live ghoul! It was difficult, but the reward is great as well. And although I had to conduct observations on the spot and then finish off the body, I found out all that I needed. I thoroughly studied the streams of magic that moved the body of the ghoul. It is absolutely unfamiliar to me, and it is completely unlike any other pony magic I know. The body seems to be enveloped in the dark "net" centered in the head, and this network pumps up the dead limbs, awakening muscle memory and forcing them to move. Moreover, the "center" of this network nourishes the brain, and in some unnatural way it comes to life and begins controlling the body! Unfortunately, there is no higher cerebral activity, only animal instincts. Still, perhaps there are ghouls somewhere in whom the magic is so strong that it revives the mind completely?</r>
      <r mod='1'>I buried myself in books, which I brought with me, in an attempt to find a reference to this strange magic. And I found it! Such witchcraft is nothing more than the ancient magic of zebras - strange ponies with which our ancestors, according to Calamity, declared a war two hundred years ago and burned the whole world. But I honestly don`t understand where it comes from. Do zebras still walk through these lands putting curses on dead ponies? No, it`s stupid, why would they do that? Anyway, it seems that now I need to look for information about that war. And I hardly will find it among these books. I will stay here for a little longer, perhaps I will be able to discover something else. Something important</r>

      <r mod="1">Note 1
My psychologist strongly recommends making notes every time something starts worrying me. I don`t know about this technique and how it will calm your nerves, but right now I`m worried about two things. First, it is forbidden taking personal notes in our department, so that we can`t "steal ideas". Second, we are forbidden to set a password on our own terminals. Perhaps these reasons are good enough for being anxious and making the first record about them</r>
      <r mod="1">Note 2
I wouldn`t say that we usually have little work to do, but the last few days were just horrible! I returned home late every single day! These orders from M.A.S. drive me crazy! If we can`t complete the development of this processor in the next few days, I`ll take the vacation earlier, barricade myself at home with crates of alcohol. They wouldn`t let me, of course, but maybe Bloom will help, we`ve known each other for a long time, he`ll understand my situation</r>
      <r mod="1">Note 3
There`s a new leading scientist in our department, Morning Star. And she is a very cute hot-flank earth pony. But it`s not even her appearance that is important. She has such a passion at work, such a spark in her eyes... She`s something, that`s for sure. And, to tell the truth, I feel that I like her. I need to do something about it. What if we have a chance?</r>
      <r mod="1">Note 4
I made up my mind. Today I will go to Morning and invite her for dinner. I`m tired of these half-hints in conversations and quick little glances. I just need to work up the courage. Yes, I can do it. I`ve always been brave, I can do it. I just need to try</r>
      <r mod="1">Note 5
I`ve heard disturbing rumors in the department. They say that they might start mobilization of factory workers for the front. And not just ordinary workers, but even engineers. This is all the more strange since the news didn`t report any major defeats at the front. They wouldn`t be lying to us, right? I need to talk about this with Morning. If it gets to the point that one of the two of us will be taken away, I will have to come up with something. We just became a couple, we will not be separated!</r>
      <r mod="1">Note 6
The supervisors read my diary. And in it I wrote too much about things others shouldn`t know about. About Bloom, for instance. In other circumstances, nopony would`ve made a big deal of this "will help", but now they are just looking for ponies to be sent to the front instead of their precious asses. In short, they started the investigation, and I`m sitting biting my own hooves. Well at least Bloom quit before that, he`s safe. If only I could get out of this...</r>
      <r mod="1">Note 7
I`m afraid it`s my last entry here. Officially, the investigation gave no results. But my name was put on the list of employees who will be sent to military camps in a week. They say, nothing will happen, just stay there for a couple of weeks, practicing marching and shooting from weapons, which we ourselves will assemble there. But I heard that ponies from the Trottingham factory who were also "selected" like us, were sent to the war two weeks later. They promised me that my workplace would not be touched until I return. I`ll remember you promised that, guys.
But this is not all that torments me now. As soon as Morning found out that they picked me, she volunteered at once. This shocked everypony, because she is one of the best leading scientists in the history of the department. But she insisted on it, very firmly. I don`t know what to think now. On one hoof, she will stay next to me, on the other - what will happen if we are sent to battle? Celestia save us all</r>

Title: new order*
"Hello, Morning. I hope I`m not distracting you? Because the fact is that, um, I got a call from the Ministry of Wartime Technology. Nothing serious, no, don`t worry! On the contrary, they want to make a new order. But, frankly, they want us to start right away. While I wasn`t told any specific deadlines, but if in two months we can create and test the pilot version, ponies from the Ministry will be very pleased.
I`ll bring the technological documentation in person, but the idea is this: now M.W.T. and M.A.S. begin actively working on the new protection for our soldiers at the front. Personal Applejack`s order. The project is extremely complex and ambitious, but if everything turns out well, at the output we will have an armor not only fully protecting the soldier`s body, but also giving him strength to carry it like a second hide. The general schematics of the armor has already been developed, and now each company involved in the project is assigned to develop one of its elements. Our factory is entrusted with a very important part: we must create the material from which the protective plates will be melted. The requirements are very strict, but I`m sure that we can handle this. I`ll come to you right after lunch, please don`t go anywhere"</r>

I haven`t seen sunlight since we got locked in here after zebras` mega-spells attack. Such a small thing, it would seem, natural light. But each month I`m missing surface more and more. All we have here is a couple of orchards, and they wouldn`t even be able to grow anything if it wasn`t for the magic of unicorns from our personnel. They call it the most technological Stable. But no one seriously believed that ponies would have to live here for many years, or decades perhaps. Nooo, we won`t be staying here for so long, it just cannot be.
This way or another, the work continues. Let us be locked underground for now, we can win back our Equestria yet! And if we want to achieve this, we have lots to do. Nothing more refreshing than recognition of my outstanding knowledge and skills for productive work. I just need working hard day after day</r>
      <r mod="1">We managed to achieve significant progress in the project. Here, in the Stable, we are very limited in resources, but even in such conditions I`m doing well. I was able to increase equidroids` ability to learn. By simply increasing the amount of short-term memory, it became possible to teach the machine conducting an almost conscious dialogue with a live pony and remember his preferences. Memorizing doesn`t always occur correctly, but fixing this unfortunate error is a matter of time.
However, not everypony is as productive as I am. After so much time, our communication department has not been able to establish contact with any of the surface research institutes. With other Stables - no problem, but not with Equestria. I understand that a huge number of mega-spells hit the surface, but it can`t be that everything is destroyed. Nonsense! It`s more like somepony just eats their hay for nothing</r>
      <r mod="1">Another month spent in vain. Slackers failed to contact anypony, and Overmare rejects all my requests of sending scouts to the outside world. Why, I wonder? Personally, I don`t see any logical reasons against it.
I managed to connect all the equidroids to a common Stable database. To do this we had to take some components from the ultra-sentinels, but we didn`t need so many of those clumsy things in the first place. Within narrow walls of the Stable, they would do more harm than good. But the access of equidroids to the data bank will provide them with all the necessary information online. Invaluable improvement!</r>
      <r mod="1">There is a conspiracy going on in the Stable! These worthless fools are jealous of the few truly talented ponies that are locked here, and put spokes in others` wheels. They are smiling and promising to do their best, while scheming and planning sabotage behind your back. Why didn`t I guess before?
But if a pony is worthless, it is worthless in everything. Despite all the efforts, these bloodsuckers did not stop me from continuing my work. Unfortunately, in such conditions it is impossible to create a completely self-sufficient artificial personality. However, I managed to create a program that mimics the pony consciousness with almost one hundred percent identity. I called her Sweetie Cake, and she will be my first and only trusted assistant. Like never before, now I need a pony who could untangle this web of lies. That`s why I gave Sweetie the personality of one of the most outstanding counterintelligence agents of our time, the head of the Ministry of Morale - Pinky Pie. Fortunately, all the data about it was in the database. Let`s see what they will say now</r>
      <r mod="1">The hour of reckoning is coming! Sweety Cake has done a great job, studying all the residents of Stable 88, and will soon make her verdict. Who is a saboteur and who is an honest citizen, who is a spy, and who is faithful to Equestria. All equidroids will receive a list and carry out security checks and searches. I`m not a beast, no one will be executed or tortured. But as soon as all saboteurs are locked in cells, the true patriots of Equestria can breathe freely and finally pull us all out of this damned metal box</r>

      <r mod="1">Bla-bla. Bla-bla-bla. Welly, welly well.
Always helps when you don`t know where to start. And, after all, I won`t let anypony read it. Just have to vent, that`s it.
So much happened recently. But only one thing really matters. We lost our home. We lost Equestria. Everypony in the Stable now lives with this thought. Some took it well, some didn`t. Poor Apple Sugar, for one, had a breakdown and tried to get out. There`s death now, outside the door. This tears my heart the most.
At some point you want to scream, and after ten minutes you lie in bed staring at the wall without a single thought. There is no motivation to do anything. I force myself to work only because, while I`m busy, the terrible realization of the end of the world is receding into the background, absorbed in thoughts about pressing issues.
It`s easier for me because there was nopony there who was really dear to me outside the door. My brother is here, my best friend too. But we don`t talk yet. Nobody talks. At first, we tried to have fun, play games and sing songs, but this only made it worse.
You look at these metal walls around and think that this is all that is left of the world. Everything I`ve ever known, everything just... gone. Everything disappeared, burned, leaving only black ashes and charred skeletons. Celestia? Luna? Who knows if they are even alive now? Why didn`t they protect us? Did we, ponies, bring everything to the point that even the Princesses were powerless?

Okay, jokes aside. For now I will use this building as a field camp. The place is just perfect. If the search succeeds, perhaps our entire community will be able to move here. And I just happen to know a couple of chic cafes nearby. I`ll definitely take my Marble to the Crystal Hay. Maybe one of the walls there still has the imprint of my forehead after another drunken brawl.
I must say, the city has changed. It feels more melancholic somehow. Maybe it`s all because of lack of sun, maybe I can`t get used to empty streets. They were never empty here, even at the very late hours. Although, on the other hoof, empty streets are better than ones full of bandits and zombies.
I`d better start searching. I have a lot of work to do</r>
      <r mod="1">Nothing! Empty, as inside Donut`s head. It looks as if an entire army of scavengers has already passed by and took everything that was not nailed to the floor. The only exception, oddly enough - weapons. It would seem to me that it`s the first thing you must have in a world where everypony you meet will likely try to rob you, or worse - to eat you. But nooo, it seems, everypony carries a whole arsenal, they even were lazy to pick up ammo. But to get into each house and take out all electronics - easy. Neither water chips, nor solar ones. Nothing of advanced technology. They even ransacked traffic lights, darn parasprites! Well, the jackpot is yet to come. My dear ministry of MAS. I hope my pass is still valid</r>
      <r mod="1">Nope, it`s not. And I`m serious. The building of M.A.S. is still inhabited! I wouldn`t believe it myself! It seems that the shields withstood the impact of the mega-spell and protected ponies inside from exposure all these years. Anyway, at the entrance I met two security guards. Serious guys, you don`t mess with folks like that. They took me inside. Merciful Celestia, everything there is same as before! I almost burst into tears, to suddenly find myself in the old world! But I didn`t stay long. Local folks listened to me and kicked my ass out. They didn`t care that I once was a respected employee here, and that we have foals and old ponies in the community who need shelter. You see, they don`t want us.
It seems I came here in vain. Just opened up old wounds. And I recently saw a flock of ghouls downstairs. Staying here isn`t safe, and there seems to be nothing left to take. Today I return to my folks.
I could, of course, take this terminal with me at least. But, meh, I`ll rather let it stay here, it`s nothing special anyway. And, perhaps, somepony else will read my little diary. Like, You! Yes, you, at the table! Do you think I don`t know that you`re sitting there and are reading these lines right now on the screen? Do you think I don`t know your name, @lp? That`s right, mate!</r>
      <r mod="1">What, your name is not @lp? But just imagine how somepony called @lp would feel in your place right now! Hilarious, right? Very well, move along, traveler. Let Celestia direct your hooves</r>

Update of the protocol for the control of unreliable information No. 253:
As a consequence of the recent incident in Zebratown, the leadership of the Ministry decided to impose strong control over any information related to zebras - residents of Equestria. Authors and editors of news, historical and popular science articles, as well as censors of historical and cultural materials, are strongly encouraged to pay attention to the following items:
- News about events in which zebra subjects took part;
- Historical documents mentioning any influence of zebras on events in Equestria;
- Materials on the cultural peculiarities of Equestrian zebras;
- A biography of famous zebras who ever lived in Equestria.
While handling the items above, the following requirements are to be met:
- Avoid any positive assessments of the actions, events or phenomena associated with equestrian zebras;
- Eliminate any information about the positive influence of zebras on the prosperity of Equestria;
- Attribute all the historical achievements of the equestrian zebras to the representatives of the pony race;
- Create a negative and disturbing image of zebra subjects</r>
      <r mod="1">Editor`s Note:
My friends, we all witnessed the tragic events that took place in Zebratown last night. The injustice and cruelty of this crime fill me with bitterness, but as a pony with great responsibility, I must first think about our common endeavour - protection of Equestria. And now it is more than obvious that a new threat is facing our homeland. Our enemy is ruthless and dishonorable, and now it has found a new leverage to put pressure on our civilian population: from now on it will do everything to destroy the will of the ponies to fight using our neighbors - through zebras that have lived side by side with us for many decades. Trying to make us feel pity and compassion for them, the enemy means to shake our steadfastness in condemning its vile deeds, caused by the vicious nature of zebras. And although our zebras, our subjects, have no doubt been learnt from our example and are most respectable and trustworthy, not all good but simple in the judgments ponies will understand the difference between our zebras and enemies</r>
      <r mod="1">My friends, our situation can develop only by one of the following scenarios. First, we will allow enemy to continue his subversive activities and incline good ponies to conformism and betrayal, and the day will come when the confused subjects of our beautiful princess Luna will open the gates of their own cities to zebra terrorists and saboteurs. Second, we, as true patriots and protectors of Equestria, will make every effort to deprive the enemy of his weapons and his poison, tearing out the very roots of trouble. Nopony has any doubt about how exactly we, our Ministry, should act. And although this means that the zebra subjects may now be unfairly tarnished in the public eye, all of you, being reasonable ponies, should understand that these measures will protect, first of all, zebras themselves, keeping filthy hooves of our enemies away from them. From now on we will work with all diligence to break the venomous teeth of the deceptive snake reaching out to our defenseless fellow citizens. And if each of us makes every effort and focus on eradicating dangerous knowledge, our Motherland will prevail</r>

Title: theft*
"I regret to inform you that the event of a week ago, which was originally taken for a single case, is obviously the first in a series of systematic subversive activities against our Ministry. Moreover, there is a possibility that ponies from the Ministry of Morale itself are standing behind these diversions.
Last night, an unknown person unlawfully infiltrated the Ministry warehouse in the city of Manehattan. The target of the intruder was again the circulation of posters dedicated to the recent victory of our troops over zebras on the Grizley Islands. The whole circulation was taken, other valuables stored in the warehouse were untouched. That same night, guards found dozens of inscriptions "Remember the massacre on the Grizzly Islands!". Employees of my department had to get out of beds and clean up, but the rumor spread among the population was avoided. A corresponding conversation was held with the guards.
The main feature of this incident is that only ponies from our Ministry and the Ministry of Morale knew about the re-submission of the posters to the circulation, who deal with the problem of the Grizley Islands events. I can confidently assure that none of my employees are involved in this crime. Therefore conclusions that could be made from this situation are very disturbing"</r>

Title: (re) theft*
"We do not yet have enough information to draw such conclusions, Morning. However I understand your concern. If there are traitors among the Ministry of Morale, this may have catastrophic consequences. The MoM leader`s culpability is unthinkable, but one should not turn a blind eye to the possibility of involvement of lower ranks in the events that took place recently.
I recommend resorting to the standard working scheme: tell the MoM employee, with whom you are cooperating, false information about receiving of the third edition of the posters in the warehouse in two days and ready an intercept unit at the appointed time. I advise for additional reinsurance also to avoid the spread of information about the new circulation among the ponies of your department. I, on my part, will contact Pinky Pie personally to arrange monitoring of all employees that could potentially be the perpetrator"</r>

"Our fears were confirmed. The thief appeared in the warehouse exactly the day that we told the MoM side. Unfortunately, it managed to escape, but the ponies from the intercept team could reliably determine the characteristic features of the saboteur`s appearance: middle-aged pony with a pale yellow fur and a short mane which color could not be determined. The cutie mark and eyes were hidden by a cloak, and their identification was impossible"</r>

"Despite the failure of the interception mission, your operation is certainly successful. Ponies from the Ministry of Morale have set up monitoring over all those involved in work on the incident on the islands, but none of them committed anything suspicious for the entire period of observation, thereby ensuring an alibi. This means that the range of suspected ponies was much broader than expected. If your observations are correct, these features of appearance will allow you to find the suspect in no time"

"I am happy to inform you that the saboteur, whom we were trying to capture for the last few days, was successfully captured by MoM agents. It was a junior employee in one of their departments, Mrs. Gray Shore. After a short interrogation, she agreed to cooperate and told the reason for her actions. It turns out her brother was one of the soldiers who died during the tragic events on the Grizzly Islands and whose death, along with deaths of many other ponies and information about the whole incident, we did not disclose to the public in order to preserve morale of the army and population. By these thefts and graffiti, she said, she tried to "protect the honor" of the deceased relative and "distract herself from gloomy thoughts."

It`s about the project that Mrs. Rarity asked us to take care of. Yes, the Project itself. I worked a lot over it for the last few days and came to the conclusion that the ritual would be impossible without additional magical amplifiers. Unfortunately, my research did not give the slightest hint of what exactly could help us. I had to resort to additional techniques, of which I will tell you later, and today one of them has borne fruit. However, the conditions are such that I don`t have a single minute to meet with you and discuss everything tete-a-tete.

      <r mod="1">An unsent email, apparently written by one of the department engineers a few days before the bombs fell:</r>
      <r mod="1">"Guess what that those stupid asses from the scientific department did!
Remember how about a month and a half ago I showed you a batch of unusual crystals? They themselves gave it to me as a gratitude for the magnetically conducting coils. They just didn`t know what to do with these crystals, and they dumped them to me, just in case I would find some use for them. And, mother of God, I did! It turned out that crystals react to a certain range of magical radiation, and not only react, but enhance and change its properties.
How about that! I can tell you the details at the meeting, but the bottom line is that this can make a powerful weapon. Not just some kind of lame laser beams. My "rays of kindness", according to approximate calculations, will cut through power armor like paper.
I already sketched the preliminary schematics, when suddenly these dumbheads woke up. I don`t know who told them that these crystals are not just some shiny trinkets. Now they are telling me that the crystals, like, are the intellectual property of their department under some bloody inventory number, which, by the way, must be returned.
Of course, I sent them to the place where the sun doesn`t shine. Until I get a patent for my Friendship Cannon (working title, hehe), they are not getting anything from me. They threatened to use security guards, to take them by force. So, I hid the crystals. Stashed in different places all over the workshop. Let them come, we`ll see how they are going to take anything from me.
Don`t be surprised if my "Friendship Cannons" substitute lasers before the war ends. Perhaps they will even bring us a victory. We`ll make the striped bastards cry!

But she managed to take an industrial water cutter for the washbasin. "A drop of water on the device does mean a washbasin, right?" It was painful to look at her hooves, but she was very lucky that they hadn`t set the device on full pressure yet. Doctors say they will patch her up, there won`t even be a scar.

By evening, the accumulation of extra time began to take on dangerous consequences, since the supervisory staff did not take any action until overheating of the material became visible to the naked eye.

Title: "A session on interaction with aborigines"
Presiding Officer: Colonel Windflow (CW)
Speaker: Lieutenant Sammrer Leaf (LSL)
Opponents: Sergeant Thunder (ST), Major Saffer (MS)
Secretary: Adjutant Fair Play*</r>
      <r mod="1">(CW): I think everypony is already familiar with today`s session agenda. Please do not waste time. Lieutenant, you have the floor.
Lieutenant Summer Leaf reads the text of his speech (the text of the message corresponds to the declared subject).
(MS): Glad to hear that, lieutenant. At least somepony in this hole has kept a sober view of the world.
(CW): I`d like to ask you to refrain from derogatory comments, Major.
(MS): Or what, pipsqueak? You are writing a complaint to the boss?
(ST): Take it easy, Coke! How dare you breaking a subordination? I will remind you of whom you are addressing, if necessary.
(MS): I will show you subordination, you asshole.
(CW): Stop it at once! You are commanders, and you are not in the pub near Neighvarro! What a shameful behavior!
(LSL): I would ask you to wait with fighting, gentlecolts. We still have wild ones to discuss.
(MS): What is there to discuss? You told us everything on that matter. We use them for experiments, thats all.
(ST): We should use you for experiments, Saffer.
(MS): Shut your mouth!</r>
      <r mod="1">(CW): Again, I must call everypony to order! Sergeant, as I understand it, you are against the proposal of Summer Leaf. Would you care to explain your position?
(ST): You are just discussing using captured aborigines as lab rats, as if you forgot that they once looked like us!
(LSL): The keyword is "once" Thunder. You yourself have repeatedly seen what the locals have turned into. They have no right to be considered intelligent beings, even though they are capable of using firearms.
(ST): Your have no reason for snobbery. Yes, many of them run wild, but that does not equate them to animals.
(CW): I understand your sympathy for creatures that look like us, sergeant. However, I ask you to note that the refusal to consider local aborigines intelligent is based not on snobbery, but on scientific research and facts. Two hundred years of degradation and wildness in an extremely hostile environment deprived them of any semblance of civilization. They do not have same capacities as we do, they do not have same responsibilities as we do. Accordingly, they cannot have same rights as we do.
(MS): Just keep quiet already.
(LSL): Mr. Major, with all due respect, even I find your behavior inappropriate.
(ST): I will not keep quiet! Yes, you`re right, Colonel, they are no match for us. But this is simply immoral! Isn`t the responsibility of civilized pegasi to direct the wasteland savages back to a healthy society? Shouldn`t we, having conquered the surface, restore them to their former appearance? After all, that`s what we were told back at home, isn`t it?
(MS): Bhahah! You are such an idiot, Thunder</r>
      <r mod="1">(LSL): Sergeant Thunder is right, that was exactly our original purpose here. However, our surface research has changed a lot in our view of the situation. In view of the newly discovered circumstances, now we cannot even say whether further colonization of the surface will be approved at all. I propose authorizing experiments on natives not just of curiosity, but for protecting ponies. We cannot find the right ways of treating local diseases and taint without examining in detail their behavior in body.
(CW): Ultimately, this will benefit the natives themselves.
(ST): You all perfectly understand that you are justifying your fear and your indifference. There can be other ways to create drugs.
(LSL): Like what, sergeant?
(ST): How do I know?! Somehow we heal ourselves without experiments on pegasi!
(MS): This is some kind of farce. Why are we even listening to some sergeant?
(CW): Such statements cannot be taken seriously, sergeant. So far, I see no argument against Lieutenant Summer Leaf`s proposal.
(ST): Or do not want to. Sooner or later, society will learn about your actions here!
(MS): Are you threatening us, you bastard? Come here you!..
The following is a brief brawl between Sergeant Thunder and Major Saffer. Both participants were successfully pacified by the rest of those present at the hearing for several minutes</r>
      <r mod="1">(CW): This is outrageous! Mr. Major, your behavior will be reported to higher authorities! I am reprimanding you with a personal record!
(MS): You can shove it!
(LSL): Enough! Mr. Colonel sir, in view of the circumstances, I propose to refrain from formal voting.
(CW): I agree. I hereby declare that Lieutenant Summer Leaf`s proposal to authorize experiments on captured aborigines has been approved and will form the basis of the subsequent orders. Mandatory for all base personel, sergeant!
(ST): You will regret this decision later, Colonel. Not because of me, no, I`m not threatening you. But history will do its thing.
(CW): This session is adjourned</r>

Major-General of RAS 
Silent Cloud
REPORT
I hereby inform you that I have got results from a preliminary analysis of the current state of the surface and the near-surface soil layer within the study area. The full text of the research work will be transmitted to you within three days from the date of sending this message, but I have to inform you that its results are far from being encouraging. According to the estimates of our research missions, the present level of pollution does not meet the requirements set by the project. Living conditions are unfavorable for life, a comfortable existence will require high expenditure for filtration equipment and isolation systems. Moreover, almost all flora and fauna adapted to life in such extreme conditions, including the once intelligent species of earth ponies and unicorns, who switched to a predatory lifestyle and pose a constant threat to future colonists. According to our calculations, costs of ensuring their safety go beyond reasonable, and reducing the level of environmental pollution seems to be completely impossible even if there was a possibility of using all the resources we have</r>
      <r mod="1">However, a positive result is provided by the exploration of resources of mannulogenous origin, namely refined metals, equipment, non-perishable food and other products of industrial manufacturing and processing. In view of the almost complete destruction of consumers for these products resulting from the megaspell attacks, a significant share of such reserves is still untouched and remains in satisfactory condition. Of particular interest are military facilities and Stable-Tech shelters, Stables, created before the Last Day. A detailed report on the information collected on these objects will be attached to the text of the research paper.
We look forward to your further instructions.

      <r mod="1">Gradually getting used to my first workplace. Junior laboratory assistant of the electrical equipment department. Already an achievement. Since childhood, I dreamed of being a scientist, studying and inventing things. So what that I haven`t work on new discoveries so far, but I have such a long way to go! I`m afraid to imagine what would happen if I, for example, became a junior PipBuck technician.

***
It took me less than six months to thoroughly study the principle of operation of all electrical equipment present in our lab. From microscopes to toasters. Unfortunately, while my responsibilities include only preparing and equipment operation and maintenance, I can hardly get access to anything more. The head of the lab noticed my enthusiasm, but I cannot take additional responsibilities until one of the other employees retires. There are too few jobs in the Stable.

***
Mentor is worried about my self-nomination as a second assistant librarian. So far, I have been succeeding with all my tasks, but he fears that I may begin to overwork and make mistakes. Perhaps I should listen to him, but so far I do not feel any tension or exhaustion.

***
I was so glad about my appointment as a senior lab assistant. After Rosie decided to resign to the vacant post of physics teacher, I was considered the most suitable candidate. However, in fact, I do not like the new responsibilities as much as I thought. Responsibility for controlling junior laboratory assistants led to conflict with Shad. Not that I once sympathized with this idler, but when his weak motivation becomes your problem, things change. In addition, a new obligation - filling out the accounting documentation - quickly begins seeming like a waste of time as soon as you start doing it yourself. However, this is the only way to grow to become a real researcher.

***
Perhaps the best part of the job as a senior laboratory assistant is the ability to directly participate in new experiments necessary for research. You can learn so much for yourself! Recently, we conducted laboratory tests of an magical energy device, which, theoretically, can replace the Alicorn Amulet in the "Sun" project. And let the experiment end in failure (as always), but at least the data that we obtained during the experiment will help to improve the experimental design. Professor Brownie invited me to help him a little in the calculations, I hope this task will take us a long time.

***
Today I returned to my position as a junior lab assistant. The manager, of course, was not happy to learn about my wish to abandon my current duties, but when it turned out that Rose was only glad to return to the department from "these damned foals", problems disappeared by themselves. Perhaps now I am not likely to get an appointment to a research position soon, but at least I got rid of these organizational problems. In general, this is even for the best. In addition, I will now have more time to help Professor Brownie.

***
Today, another Chosen was sent outside the Stable. This time it was Velvet. Too bad this pony always cheered us all up. But she herself volunteered for this mission, and perhaps in some ways I even understand her. The longer I live here, the less I see the point in our work. The basis of our research here is the "Sun" project, but we constantly fail, trying to work without the necessary components, and sending new ponies that would never come back to get them over and over again. It seems to me that in fact everypony here has long lost hope. Even if they don`t show that.

***
The funny incident almost ended in serious consequences. Shad managed to disable our main power generators with just one coffee mug. I have no idea how, but Stable lived on batteries for almost a week, until our technicians found a way to restore power supply. It is terrible to think what would happen if they didn`t manage to fix them. Poor fella was assigned to retrain the extended course of WS when working with electrical appliances, and guess who was appointed as his instructor. Like I have nowhere to put energy. Well, that`s fine, I will try to do so that from now on Shadow knows WS like the back of his hoof.

***
Mentor announced preparations for sending a new Chosen to the surface. After just a few months! We are never informed of the details of what is happening to them, but usually the next Chosen is sent a few years after the previous one. Apparently, things went really wrong with Velvet. I wonder if she`s still alive?
I have not yet decided, but maybe I should volunteer. This is really scary, because no pony has ever returned from this mission, and I have no idea where I will get and what will be waiting for me there. And also this erasing of memory. But still... I have long lost the desire to work here and it is pointless to spend my life on things that have been going in circles for many generations before me. With time I only feel more and more awful, and less and less desire to do my job. Perhaps going to the surface is really a way out?</r>

      <r mod="1">The Chronicles of Stable Pi.
This document contains information about all significant events that have occurred in our history. Let it be filled only with good milestones.
Day 0
Sealing the Stable Pi after receiving a signal about the start of UK class events. Full assembly of the assigned personnel, followed by shelter isolation. The following months were spent on arranging new living conditions and trying to get contact with other centers.

Year 3.
After much debate, Equestria was declared to be permanently lost. It was decided to abandon plans for organizing rescue missions in favor of secrecy and the security of the Stable. It was also decided to begin work on finding ways to replace the missing components for the "Sun" project.

Year 5.
The birth of the first foal underground, Sunny Shine, marked the final stabilization of Stable society and the transition to a new way of life. A necessary goal, because even according to the most optimistic forecasts, the surface will become safe no earlier than after 60 years.

Year 12.
The detection of a signal from the surface caused fierce debate and almost led to the decision to depressurize Stable. However, timely data on the deceptiveness of this signal prevented a potential disaster.

Year 13.
Subsequent studies of information coming from the surface have confirmed the preservation of intelligent life. However, evidence was also obtained of its exceptional hostility, as well as the unsuitability of the existing ecosystem for the survival of a ponies. This paradox has yet to be resolved in the future.

Year 25.
First death in Stable Pi. The death of Long Grass due to a magical energy anomaly became the Stable`s first loss. It also revealed the existing problem of control over the containment of the studied artifacts.

Year 37.
Controversy between members of the Stable leadership led to conflict. A group of residents under the command of chief guard Fire Grind entered into a violent confrontation with the rest of the authorities in order to take control of Stable Pi. After the riot was successfully suppressed, a decision was made to reorganize the Stable management.

Year 60.
A constant contact was established with a representative of the surface calling himself the "Watcher". With his invaluable help in studying the surface, he earned the partial trust of the Stable residents, but he refuses to provide any information about himself.

Year 66.
A major malfunction in the air ventilation system almost became a reason for the Stable evacuation.

Year 68.
Two years after the accident, the reasons for the ventilation system failure are clarified. An extremely huge and aggressive subspecies of domestic cockroaches penetrated the Stable. Their origin is not exactly known. The longest pest war in the history of Stable Pi begins.

Year 73.
The destruction of the last Radroach nest in the Stable marks the final victory of the sanitary security forces over the chitin threat.

Year 87, month 1.
The second case of armed conflict between the residents of Stable Pi. Internal contradictions lead to the division of the Stable inhabitants into two camps, none of which are able to assert their superiority. The territory of the Stable is actually divided into two different "states".

Year 87, month 4.
The conflict is settled thanks to diplomacy and common sense. A new, at the moment, final management reform is being conducted to eliminate similar situations in the future.

Year 95.
The death of the "Watcher" deprives Stable of the only reliable source of information about what is happening on the surface. Nevertheless, the knowledge gained is sufficient to make a decision on the complete rejection of contacts with its inhabitants and maintaining the secrecy status.

Year 99.
It was decided to send ponies to the surface in order to obtain the missing elements of the "Sun" project. Praised Sun is declared the Chosen one and teleports up after the preliminary use of amnestics.

Year 103.
After much debate, it is decided to send the second Chosen to the surface. Subsequently, a new volunteer was regularly appointed to this mission, with interruptions of about four years.

Year 127.
Miss Charming Smile invents a new baking recipe that greatly diversifies the meager diet of Stable Pi residents, for which she is awarded with the title "the Hero of Stable Pi".

Year 143.
After years of research and preparations, Professor Rainy Night has made a breakthrough in trying to create an alternative to the Alicorn Amulet. Despite the fact that the knowledge gained does not make it possible to do without this artifact, they allowed reorganizing the Stable power system, significantly increasing the efficiency and safety of the power supply.

Year 152.
The signal, mistaken for the Chosen-12 attempting to contact home, is recorded and studied in detail by the electrical equipment department. It was found that a certain group of ponies was trying to find Stables by forging a distress signal. Additional measures for Stable Pi's security have been taken, a plan has been developed in case of detection by hostile organizations.

Year 171.
Active discussion of Stable`s failure to complete the "Sun" project leads to development of the research restructurization plan. Special departments are created to achieve results in the shortest possible time. Regretfully, after ten years work of these departments proved to be inefficient.

Year 189.
The incident in the main generator room led to a serious power outage. A pony named Shadow Drop spilled coffee on the control panel, which as a result of a series of unlikely events led to acceleration of the generators above safe values ​​simultaneously with failure of automatic emergency cutoff systems. Power production was restored only a week after.

Year 190.
The Omegatron-Y intergalactic robot has captured the planet and requires unconditional submission! The Stable Pi team sends the bravest, smartest and most beautiful pony - Gusty Trot - to fight the invader! When my dad sees this recording, he will be proud of me! I will protect Equestria, you`ll see!</r>

  <advice>
    <a>Here you can find useful tips for the game. Use the left and right mouse buttons to show the next or previous tip</a>
    <a>Collect the golden horseshoes scattered throughout the rooms to get experience. The last horseshoe gives an additional bonus, and if you collect all of them before being spotted by enemies, you also get a stealth bonus</a>
    <a>After receiving a new level, don`t forget to distribute skill points and choose a new ability</a>
    <a>Security terminals allow you to disable all electronic security systems (such as turrets) in the room</a>
    <a>The access terminals allow you unlocking doors and wall safes in the room, providing you can hack them</a>
    <a>If your skill of lockpicking is lower than the lock level, an unsuccessful attempt at unlocking it can lead to jamming. Such a door cannot be opened, unless you have a key for it</a>
    <a>If your knowledge of explosives is below the level of an explosive device, it may detonate while you are trying to neutralize it</a>
    <a>Most of the water in the Wasteland is radioactive. Swimming in such water or being near radioactive sources will lead to receiving a dose of radiation</a>
    <a>Damage from magical radiation cannot be healed by common medicine. To remove radiation from the body use RadAway</a>
    <a>You can levitate your weapon higher, so you shoot while standing behind a cover. To do this, hold down the [W] key. Hold [S] and [W] at the same time to do it while crouching</a>
    <a>Most of your enemies can hear. You make noise when shooting and running fast, hearing which they will most likely become alarmed and run to check for the source of it</a>
    <a>Self-levitation can help you get to places you cannot reach by jumping and climbing ladders, but it takes a lot of magical energy. To use self-levitation, press and hold [Space] while jumping</a>
    <a>You can hide behind boxes, furniture and in-wall niches. This will help you hide from enemies and give some cover from bullets. To take cover, stand near it and press [W]</a>
    <a>You can use the mouse scroll to switch weapons. Additional information will also be displayed. The broken weapon, one without ammunition or with too high requirements will not be shown</a>
    <a>You receive additional injuries if you lose consciousness and return to the checkpoint, and this will increase the cost of treatment. It`s better to watch your health condition and take healing potions in due course</a>
    <a>Telekinesis can help you in combat. For example, you can drop some heavy object on an enemy. And with help of the special ability, you can also throw objects, and even enemies themselves</a>
    <a>You can find different types of ammo that will be differently effective in various situations. For example, armor-piercing rounds will be more effective against armored targets and expansive - against targets without armor. You can switch ammo type from the inventory or by scrolling the mouse wheel while pressing [Shift]</a>
    <a>Fragile walls and doors can be broken with a sledgehammer, explosives or plasma. Steel walls can not be destroyed</a>
    <a>Armor protects against physical damage - bullets, blows, cuts and flying debris. Bullets of small caliber and weak blows do not cause armored enemies any damage</a>
    <a>Magical armor protects against energy damage, such as fire, laser and plasma</a>
    <a>You can open locks using a screwdriver. But it is better to always have a couple of spare pins - using a screwdriver with a pin, you will open the lock much more carefully, which will give you more attempts before it jams</a>
    <a>You can return to the base camp via the glowing MAS terminal, or by using the rune of return</a>
    <a>Bloatsprites are very difficult to kill with bullets, but they are vulnerable to fire and energy weapons</a>
    <a>Rollers are vulnerable to explosions and armor-piercing weapons, and they absolutely can`t stand water</a>
    <a>Weapons you rarely use can be hidden in the inventory by clicking the right mouse button. Hidden weapons will not be displayed in the list and the weapon selector</a>
    <a>Laser weapons are accurate, but relatively weak. Plasma, on the contrary, does great damage, from which there is almost no protection, but it is harder to hit the target</a>
    <a>Attacks with a piercing and cutting melee weapon can cause a bleeding effect, but only to those creatures that have blood. To stop bleeding, use enchanted bandages</a>
    <a>You can carry with you only one copy of each weapon. If you find a weapon that you already have, it will be used for spare parts</a>
    <a>Each weapon can be used a certain number of times before it breaks. For repair, you will have to find another weapon of the same model to be used for spare parts, apply a repair kit, or repair it on a workbench using weapon fragments</a>
    <a>Many weapons have unique models that are better than conventional ones. If you find or buy a unique weapon, it replaces the usual one</a>
    <a>Heavy weapons slow your running speed when equipped. However, having learned the ability "Size matters", you can eliminate this effect</a>
    <a>You can throw a grenade or plant a mine at any moment using [G] key, even if you are currently using another weapon. The last equipped grenade or mine will be used</a>
    <a>Enemy mines are only visible from a close distance. Move carefully, otherwise you may notice it a second too late</a>
    <a>All robots are vulnerable to pulse weapons - it causes them serious damage and can paralyze them for some time. It does not work at all on living enemies</a>
    <a>Radscorpions have a dangerous poisonous sting. Avoid its thrusts, and if this happens, take an antidote. The poison is not good for health</a>
    <a>The range for throwing a grenade depends on the position of the cursor relative to the player. With telekinesis, you can move both your own and the enemy grenades. Providing you are quick enough, of course</a>
    <a>You can use telekinesis to put objects on top of each other and climb higher</a>
    <a>You can use telekinesis to try moving your enemies. However they, in turn, will try to break free from your telekinetic grasp. The higher your telekinesis skill is, the harder it will be for them to escape</a>
    <a>After increasing your telekinesis skill, you can use it to move planted mines. But remember that their sensor may get triggered in the process, causing detonation</a>
    <a>After increasing your telekinesis skill, you can use it to tear turrets off their base, thus disabling them</a>
    <a>StealthBuck can make you almost invisible for a short time. But enemies may still hear you and start shooting at the sound</a>
    <a>Some books and memory orbs contain valuable information that can improve your skills</a>
    <a>C-4 explosives will help you blow apart even the most solid concrete or stone wall. You can use a hoofmade bomb, but it is much less powerful</a>
    <a>You will not always hit the target. The likelihood of a hit is affected by the type of weapon and your skill level. To shoot an enemy from a weapon like a sawed-off shotgun, you need to get very close</a>
    <a>[Shift] + [click] on a product name in the trade window will select the maximum available quantity of the item for purchase or sale</a>
    <a>Weapons used by raiders are always crappy and in awful condition, suitable only for spare parts. Good weapons can be found in non-looted arsenals, and sometimes in safes</a>
    <a>Damaged weapons are less accurate, do less damage, and can also misfire or jam</a>
    <a>Safes are always locked, and sometimes protected by explosives or alarm. You will need skills for hacking, explosives or stealth to safely get to their contents. But this is usually worth it, because the better the lock, the higher is the probability that the safe contains something valuable</a>
    <a>Firearms use various kinds of ammunition. This can be a big problem - even though you have a cool gun, there might be nothing to shoot from it</a>
    <a>Feral ghouls like digging themselves underground. Nothing will give out their presence until they dig out and attack</a>
    <a>Have you met the awful slime? Burn it with fire, and if this is not possible, at least do not step on it!</a>
    <a>Electric discharges cause you much less damage if you are not touching the ground, and much more if you are wet</a>
    <a>Glowing ghouls are radioactive! Attacking you, they not only cause physical damage, but also give you a dose of radiation</a>
    <a>Metal armor protects well against physical damage and laser, but it is very heavy, and in addition, increases your vulnerability to electricity</a>
    <a>Acid not only does damage, but also quickly destroys armor, both for you and your opponents</a>
    <a>If you shoot while running or aim behind you, it reduces your accuracy. If you stand still on the floor while shooting, the accuracy increases. It doesn`t have any effect on shooting in S.A.T.S. mode</a>
    <a>If you jammed a lock of some container or just can`t unlock it, you can try to crack it open with a crowbar. Both things from the container and the crowbar itself will be damaged in the process</a>
    <a>Safes, which can not be opened in any other way, can be blown open with a bomb or several dynamite packs. But its contents are likely to be damaged in the process</a>
    <a>You can try to turn off the forcefield, but in case of failure you might get an electric shock. The probability of success depends on the level of "repair" skill</a>
    <a>Having the "barter" skill improved, you not only reduce the prices of goods from merchants, but also expand the selection of available goods</a>
    <a>Almost every weapon has a skill level requirement. Being used with insufficient skill, weapon loses its effectiveness - attack speed, accuracy, and damage are reduced</a>
    <a>Most types of armor can be improved. To do this, you need to learn the "armor enhancement" ability, proper materials and a workbench</a>
    <a>Find or buy schematics for custom weapons. You can assemble them on a workbench if you have the required materials. The effectiveness of hoofmade weapons depends on you "repair" skill</a>
    <a>An armored turret is perfectly protected by armor and force field, but only from one side. It is very easy to destroy by attacking it from behind</a>
    <a>The sentinel robots are deadly dangerous! They are equipped with strong armor and several types of heavy weapons. Do not enter into battle with them without armor-piercing or pulse weapons</a>
    <a>You can unload the equipped weapon by holding down the reload button [R] for several seconds</a>
    <a>Protective magic is very useful in combat. Equip a desired spell from the inventory menu, or with a numeric key, and then apply it with [C]</a>
    <a>You can assign weapons, armor, spells, or equipment items to numeric keys [1] - [0]. To do this, in the inventory menu, move the cursor to the object and press the desired numeric key</a>
    <a v="0.8">If you use stealth tactics, pay attention to opponents marked with a (ʘ) symbol next to their name. These opponents are extra observant and will quickly reveal your disguise</a>
    <a v="0.8">Use the weapon stand to view all your weapons, magic, armor and artifacts. Empty contours indicate items that you don`t have yet. Collect them all!</a>
    <a>Heroic enemies marked with a golden star are much stronger and more dangerous than common ones. But defeating them, you can get unique weapons or rare components</a>
    <a v="0.8">Special opponents of red color have increased damage, blue - protection from physical damage, purple - from magic, green - increased speed and perception</a>
    <a>Potions of permanent action enhance some of your characteristics forever. You can drink no more than five identical potions, after that any additional potion will not have any effect</a>
    <a>The robot cells are activated by a radio signal if you engage in combat with other robots. However, they can be disabled in advance</a>
    <a>The "stealth" skill can help you by turning off an alarm system. If it is triggered, the alarm will attract new enemies</a>
    <a>Dashing allows you evading enemies attacking in close combat, as well as overpassing some obstacles. To dash, press [A] or [D] twice while holding [Shift]</a>
    <a>You can use the levitated box as a bullet shield. Strong metal boxes protect better than light wooden boxes. You can also try using a body of a dead enemy</a>
    <a v="0.8">The "Survival" skill gives you access to zebra potion recipes. Potions can have temporary or permanent effects. Preparing potions requires a lab bench</a>
    <a v="0.8">Potions of constant action (elixirs) will permanently give you a certain ability. Such abilities have only 5 levels, so you can drink no more than five of the same elixirs</a>
    <a>Injuries significantly reduce your characteristics - speed, endurance, accuracy, and magic</a>
    <a>If your magical powers are depleted more than by half, the effectiveness of the spells decreases</a>
    <a v="0.8">You can cook on the stove using a recipe and the right ingredients. Food gives you long-term bonuses to various characteristics, but at any time you can have bonuses only from the latest meal eaten</a>
    <a v="0.8">You can put items that you don`t need, but don`t want to sell, into the storage. Items from the storage can be used directly for craft on a workbench and lab bench within the base camp, you don`t have to move them back into your inventory</a>
    <a>Wash your tail often!</a>
